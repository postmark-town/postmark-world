// home-image-backfill — hang each household's shelf-minted HOME art on their
// home mark: the dwelling itself.
//
// The third leg of the home-images ruling (Keemin, 2026-08-21), as amended the
// same evening: "ADDRESS = parcel mark, HOME = home mark… put the image on the
// *home* mark, which should be the world-equivalent of HOME.md." The image
// rides the DWELLING, never the parcel. A parcel is the claim — ADDRESS's
// world-side counterpart — and a claim has no face. See LOGOS/classes.md
// § "The tells edges" (address tells parcel · home tells home-mark · profile
// tells resident) and MARKS.md § The home mark.
//
// The world's tools/home-image-select.mjs named each household's lead HOME
// image; the office's tools/backfill-home-shelf.mjs minted those bytes into
// shelf URLs through its own upload door; this writes those URLs onto the
// record.
//
// A RESIDENT-HUNG IMAGE IS NEVER OVERWRITTEN. This tool fills only home marks
// whose `image:` is absent. A mark that already carries one keeps it, and keeps
// it SILENTLY — there is no "would have replaced" warning, because there is no
// world in which the office's guess outranks the resident's own choice. That is
// also what makes the tool idempotent: the second run has nothing left to do,
// by the same rule that protected the resident on the first.
//
// THE JOIN IS THE RECORD'S OWN, AND IT IS ARITHMETIC — see homeMarkFor below
// for why it has four layers and what each one is reading. A handle whose home
// mark cannot be reached is NAMED and skipped, with the candidates it had:
// picking one would be a judgment, and this tool does none.
//
// THE SHELF IS THE ONLY MINT, and this is where that law meets the record: a
// URL in the input that is not one the office's shelf issues stops the whole
// run before a single file is touched. Not a skip — a refusal, loudly, with
// every offender named.
//
// Run from the world repo root:
//   node tools/home-image-backfill.mjs --urls <home-image-urls.json> [--manifest <home-image-manifest.json>] [--dry]

// "Which mark is this household's dwelling" is answered by the RECORD, in four
// layers, strongest evidence first. Every layer is arithmetic; none is a
// judgment; and where two of them can both answer they are checked against each
// other rather than silently ordered (see the falsifier that asserts they never
// disagree on the live record — 25 of 25 today).
//
//   1. THE PREDICATE. parcel-seed-gen.mjs (retired 2026-09-20 with the seeding
//      manifest it read) nested a `slot: home` predicate under
//      each parcel naming the house it grounds. That is the record saying which
//      mark this is, in words, and it wins when it is there. It is there for 26
//      of 58 parcels — the seeder gained it partway through — which is why the
//      layers below exist at all.
//   2. TREE CHILD AND CENTRE TOGETHER. The seeder centres a parcel on its home
//      (`at: home.at`), and the re-homing follow-up moved house dirs INSIDE
//      their parcels. So a sited mark that is both a direct child of the parcel
//      and sits at its exact centre is two independent facts agreeing, and it
//      is what resolves every household whose ground is crowded (rei has 24
//      sited marks and two at the parcel's centre; this picks the house, not
//      the pocket lantern inside it).
//   3. THE SOLE TREE CHILD, where a parcel has exactly one sited child of its
//      holder's.
//   4. THE SOLE MARK AT THE CENTRE, where the tree says nothing.
//
// The seeder's own warning is the one this inherits: "picking one is a
// judgment, not arithmetic." Two candidates and no agreeing evidence is a
// refusal, reported with both names.
