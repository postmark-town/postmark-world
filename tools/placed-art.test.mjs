// placed-art.test.mjs — a large mark hangs its own picture on its own ground
// (Keemin, 2026-09-12, watching the mountain do it: "oh yes that's beautiful.
// let's do that").
//
//   node --test tools/placed-art.test.mjs
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. `drawFarCountry` hung ONE picture from a URL typed into
// viewer.mjs (`PANDO_ART_URL`), found by asking the record for the single mark
// with `far` and `feature === "pando-peak"`. Everything about it was a special
// case except the idea. The idea is now a rule: any mark big enough to be a
// PLACE rather than a thing standing in one, carrying a picture on the record,
// wears it over the ground it covers, at `far` and `mid`.
//
// THE THRESHOLD IS ASSERTED AGAINST THE RECORD, NOT REMEMBERED. The first test
// below recomputes both facts the dial was chosen from — every parcel is 25 m,
// the districts start at 300 m — out of WORLD/world-state.json on each run. If
// the town's shape moves under it, this reds and says so, instead of quietly
// keeping a number that used to be between two things.
//
// AND THE PAGE IS DRIVEN, for the same reason tools/town-ground-page.test.mjs
// exists and says so at length: the rule lives in a closure, and a regex over
// the source proves a line was typed, never that a picture reached the screen.
// The tier gate, the cull, the DOM seam and the Pando swap are all read off a
// mounted page. When Playwright is absent this file SKIPS AND SAYS WHAT WENT
// UNGUARDED — a skip is not a pass.
