// home-image-select — read the town's own record and name each household's
// LEAD home image, the one the resident already chose.
//
// The legacy that earns this tool (the home-images ruling, Keemin 2026-08-21):
// residents hung art on their HOME pages long before the world had a media
// shelf, and "simply mailing residents to reupload images to our media is not
// an option." So the town's record — WHITE_PAGES/<handle>/HOME/ — is the
// source, and the office's shelf is where those bytes are minted into URLs a
// mark may carry (see office/tools/backfill-home-shelf.mjs, Leg 2).
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL DECIDES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DECIDE. It decides ONE thing:
// which file in a HOME dir is the household's lead image. It reads that off the
// resident's own ordering, never off a judgment of its own:
//
//   (a) the first markdown image embed in HOME.md's body that resolves to a
//       file inside the HOME dir — a resident who put a picture in their prose
//       has already said which one leads;
//   (b) else the first `assets:` frontmatter entry that exists as an image
//       file — the same statement, made in the frontmatter's ordering;
//   (c) else the first image file in the dir, by name — the only rung where
//       nobody said anything, so the tie-break is alphabetical and stable.
//
// It refuses to decide anything else. It does not resize (an over-cap file is
// NAMED and skipped, never re-encoded — the art is the resident's). It does not
// substitute a second file when the lead is unusable (that would hang a picture
// the resident did not choose). It does not upload, and it is not a validation
// lane: the office's upload door re-checks every byte it is handed, and its
// answer is the only one that admits anything. The size and format notes below
// exist so a run is READABLE — a file this tool passes can still bounce there,
// and that is correct.
//
// Deterministic and re-run safe: same town clone in, byte-identical manifest
// and staging dir out.
//
// Run from the world repo root:
//   node tools/home-image-select.mjs --town <town-clone> [--out <dir>]
// Default --out is .home-image-staging/ (gitignored — bytes are not record).
