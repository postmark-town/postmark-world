// viewer-interior.test.mjs — THE ROOM AS A SCENE OF THE ONE ENGINE.
//
// The founder's ruling (2026-08-20): ONE ENGINE, ONE RENDER, DIFFERENT SCENES.
// A room renders through the same painting machinery as the town — the same
// pips, the same hover, the same click precedence — and the ONLY scene-unique
// element is the GROUND: a white placeholder, replaced by the mark's own image
// when it has one, overlaid with an svg art slot, mirroring the atlas's own
// base-raster-svg structure. The custom interior renderer this file used to
// test is gone; what remains under test here is the DATA path (occupancy →
// room → furniture → radial), the room card and the plaque (chrome), the
// ground builder, and the rim. The scene swap itself is exercised at the rig
// (scene-qa), and so is the room card on the painting in both view modes.
