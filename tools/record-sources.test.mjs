// record-sources.test.mjs — the read-time half of the world-pin guardrail.
//
//   node --test tools/record-sources.test.mjs
//
// The site's release lane resolves its world pin under three guardrails the
// founder ruled on 2026-08-25. This file asserts the FIRST one, quoted verbatim
// from that ruling and not paraphrased:
//
//     "tags only, never main tip."
//
// The site enforces it at build time (`tools/lib/world-pin.mjs`, falsified in
// `test/world-pin.test.mjs` over there). What was never enforced is the other
// end: the page itself used to fetch
// `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/postmark-town/postmark-world/main/...` whenever
// a record was missing same-origin — and one record, `WORLD/walk-ledger.md`, was
// missing from the site's staging list, so that leg was taken on EVERY load of
// postmark.town/world. Prod's departures were told from unblessed main while the
// build obeyed the law.
//
// Two shapes of probe, because one of them is not enough:
//
//   1. THE DECISION. `recordSources` is pure, so the chain it builds can be
//      read and asserted directly. If somebody adds a third leg, this goes red.
//   2. THE BYTES. A decision module can be bypassed by one inline `fetch`, which
//      is exactly how the original leg was written. So the viewer's own source
//      text is read and asserted to contain no main-tip URL at all.
//
// Both are paired with a case that proves the probe can still fail: an assertion
// that no input produces a forbidden URL is worth nothing if the detector cannot
// recognise a forbidden URL when handed one.

  // builds — and the test below requires a local route for every record here,
  // which is a route to a file the package does not carry.
  //
  // `/seeding/manifest.json` left this list the same way and for the same
  // reason (2026-09-20, postmark#3025): the manifest is deleted, the viewer no
  // longer fetches it and `spectator/server.mjs` no longer serves it, so a row
  // here would name a chain to a file that is not in the package.
