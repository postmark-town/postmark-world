// marks-fold.mjs — canon is a fold over the marks register + the stake lines.
// Pure function: (WORLD/marks/**, WORLD/skeleton.json, stakes, prevState?) -> world-state.
// Anyone with a clone can recompute the world. See MARKS.md (the law this implements).
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/marks-fold.mjs                      # fold the repo, write WORLD/world-state.json + WORLD/INDEX.md
//   node tools/marks-fold.mjs --stakes f.json      # override stakes source (sims/tests)
//   node tools/marks-fold.mjs --allow-stampless    # write a zero-escrow world on purpose, saying what it drops
//   node tools/marks-fold.mjs --marks-dir d --prev prev.json --tick N --no-write --json
//
// Stakes source: a JSON file of open positions —
// [{ holder, mark, n, weight, tick }], negative n = withdrawal — passed with
// `--stakes`. `n` is raw escrow; `weight` is its town-derived read-side
// contribution (Σ escrow + k·unique-households across a mark). There is NO default
// source and no money or household-identity parser in this repo (write-release
// P3): the stamp ledger and identity pins live in the TOWN repo, which owns their
// grammar and derives this file for us —
//   (town clone)  node tools/world-stake.mjs --escrow --json > stakes.json
// so exactly one parser reads the money lines across the two repos. Without the
// file the world folds with zero escrow, which is honest for a world that holds
// none — and a silent deletion for one that does, so the WRITE refuses rather
// than the fold (see § the stamp gate).
// (The header used to document a `stake:mark:<id>` grammar the mint could never
// produce — a read-side orphan, flagged 2026-07-23, closed by this pass.)

// ---------- the frame (SCHEMA v3 § The frame, 2026-08-09) ----------
// A mark's `at:` is written in ITS OWN FRAME — as an offset from the centre of
// the mark it sits inside. The world root IS the frame and keeps world numbers;
// everything nested carries its parent's centre implicitly, so moving a
// container carries its contents with it. The directory tree already says what
// contains what; under v3 the coordinates say it too, and the two cannot drift.
//
// The frame is a property of the TREE, not of the tools: the world root declares
// it on its own record (`coords: relative`, written beside the extent it
// governs), so a clone, a sketchbook, or a temp fixture carries its own frame
// with it. A tree that declares nothing is v2 absolute and loads exactly as it
// always did — the composition below is skipped entirely and `at`/`points` keep
// the very objects the parser built.
//
// Composition happens HERE, once, at load. Everything downstream — the fold, the
// lint, the vessel, the walk engine, the verbs — reads `at` in world coordinates
// and cannot tell which frame the files were written in. That is the whole
// point: exactly one function knows, and it is this one.
// ---------- the tier binding (founder ruling, 2026-08-11 evening) ----------
// A PARENT BINDS A CHILD ONLY IF ITS TIER IS EQUAL OR HIGHER. That one sentence
// governs the frame, and it is the difference between a world where the town's
// own river can be dragged by whoever files a meadow around it and one where it
// cannot.
//
// A BOUND child (parent rank >= child rank) is framed by its parent: its `at:`
// is an offset from that parent's centre, and moving the parent carries it —
// the v3 frame, unchanged.
//
// An OUTRANKING child is framed by the WORLD. Nothing its parent does moves it.
// The directory still says what contains what — a constitution reach may well
// sit inside a resident's canopy, and the tree should say so — but containment
// is no longer authority: the paper says where it stands, not who may move it.
// When geometry drifts so the edge stops naming the tightest container, the
// machinery RE-POINTS the edge (mark-lint's REHOME, applied by the settlement
// sweep). Re-pointing an outranking child is pure paper, because its numbers
// never mentioned its parent in the first place.
//
// A PREDICATE is exempt: it is its parent continued (SCHEMA § the continuation
// law), so it can never outrank what it predicates — the lint refuses one that
// tries, rather than framing it somewhere its parent is not.
//
// ---------- what the rank is READ FROM (Keemin's ruling, 2026-08-12) ----------
// THE ONE WALK, NEVER THE FIELD. The binding rule above is unchanged; what
// changed is where it gets a mark's rank. It used to read the `tier:` line the
// record carried, which let a resident DECLARE authority over their own ground
// — and three of them did, writing `tier: sovereignty` on their houses. Under
// the rule above that made each house OUTRANK the parcel it stands on, so its
// own fence could no longer frame it and it anchored to the world instead:
// exactly the mis-binding this replaces. Standing is derived now
// (tools/mark-standing.mjs), and a resident's derived standing is never above
// market, because the point of "your own parcel is yours" is that your house
// BINDS to your ground and rides when you move it. Ranking above your own fence
// is not sovereignty; it is escaping it.
//
// So the ladder has exactly two live rungs on resident ground — draft below,
// everything else at market — and the town's constitution above them. That is
// the whole of the frame's authority question: is this the town's law, or is it
// not. `tierRank` stays exported (the migration's before-side probe imports it,
// and the schema's own vocabulary is still four words) but NOTHING in the
// engine path reads it any more; `standingRank` is the input.

// for everything the walk decides at hop 0 (a parcel, a sovereign structure).

// the directories. A mark's directory is now historical filing that claims
// nothing; this map claims everything, and is thrown away and rebuilt at every
// fold, which is what keeps it from rotting the way a stored path does.
//
// TWO DERIVATIONS, because there are two kinds of edge in this world and only one

//                        consulted.
//   predicated /       — PREDICATION. A predicate is its parent continued (the
//   naming / class       continuation law, `the-town/the-continuation`); it has
//                        no footprint to contain and no coordinates to compare,

//                        ground, and the freeze does not touch it.
//
// `parent: null` belongs to the world root alone. Everything the ground puts
// under nothing else is under the root, named — a chain that stops short of the
// frame is a chain with a hole in it.
// The world root, recognised in EITHER shape this file's functions are handed:
// a loader record carries `slug`, a published `state.marks` row carries only

/**
 * THE PARCELS, IN CLAIM ORDER — the order the cap is applied in, and a ruling
 * rather than a tidy-up.
 *
 * The gate refuses a parcel when its household ALREADY HOLDS `PARCEL_CLAIM_CAP`
 * admitted ones, so WHICH parcel is refused is decided entirely by the order the
 * loop runs in. That order was `byId`'s insertion order, which is `loadMarks`'
 * `readdirSync` walk — the filesystem's directory listing. A household over the
 * cap lost whichever of its parcels the walk reached fourth, and adding an
 * unrelated mark anywhere in the tree could move that to a different one on the
 * next crossing. A resident's ground is not a thing that may flicker.
 *
 * It was invisible while the registry was stale, because a stale registry filed
 * a family's handles as strangers and no household was over the cap at all.
 * Measured on world main `d38a5f7e` with the registry refreshed from the town:
 * the walk refuses `spark-the-builder/the-workshop-on-the-terrace-parcel`,
 * claimed 2026-08-09, while `berthillon/chez-antoine`, claimed seventeen days
 * later, stands. Nothing about the record says that; the directory order does.
 *
 * FIRST THREE BY CLAIM DATE STAND. The law is "a HOUSEHOLD may CLAIM at most 3
 * parcels" with "prior estate stands" — both statements about WHEN — so the
 * order the gate reads them in is the order they were claimed. Ties break on id,
 * so the verdict is a function of the record and of nothing else.
 *
 * ── IT CARRIES TWO OTHER RULES WITH IT, AND THAT IS THE THING TO KNOW ────────
 *
 * The same loop decides parcel OVERLAP ("first-in-order wins") and ONE PARCEL
 * PER HANDLE ("relocation = replace, not add"). Ordering by claim date means the
 * EARLIER claim wins an overlap and the earlier of a handle's two parcels is the
 * one kept. That is the same answer the cap now gives, which is why they move
 * together rather than each on its own key — but it is a change to three rules
 * and not to one, and anyone reading this line as a sort should know that.
 *
 * On world main `d38a5f7e`, under both the standing registry and one refreshed
 * from the town, neither of those two rules changes its verdict: no parcel
 * overlaps another and no handle holds two. That is a fact about today's tree,
 * measured rather than assumed, and not a property of the ordering.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES TO TODAY'S TREE, MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Against the registry AS COMMITTED on `d38a5f7e` this ordering changes NOTHING:
 * the fold is identical mark for mark, 89 parcels admitted and 0 errors either
 * way, because the stale registry files every family's handles as strangers and
 * no household is over the cap at all. It becomes visible only once the registry
 * is refreshed, which is the office lane it travels with.
 *
 * Against a registry refreshed from the town it moves the refusal set from
 *
 *     spark-the-builder/the-workshop-on-the-terrace-parcel   claimed 2026-08-09
 *     little-pica/the-nest-on-the-middle-terrace-parcel      claimed 2026-09-01
 *
 * to
 *
 *     berthillon/chez-antoine                                claimed 2026-08-26
 *     little-pica/the-nest-on-the-middle-terrace-parcel      claimed 2026-09-01
 *     histor-reeves/the-gauge-house-parcel                   claimed 2026-09-08
 *
 * — it gives the earliest claim back and refuses the latest, which is what
 * "prior estate stands" says. THE COUNT GOES UP, from two to three: the walk
 * reached `histor-reeves/the-gauge-house-parcel` before four of the Reeves'
 * pre-law parcels and admitted it at a count of two, and claim order does not.
 * Whether those three are refused at all is the founder's question and not this
 * function's; `PARCEL_CAP_EXCEPTIONS` above is the mechanism for answering it.
 *
 * NOT APPLIED AT `admitDelta`'s gate, deliberately. That loop walks EVERY kind
 * of candidate and the parcel branch is nested inside it, so ordering it by date
 * would reorder duplicate-id detection and containment resolution for marks that
 * have nothing to do with parcels — not a sort, a rewrite. It also seeds its
 * count from `base.parcelsByCred`, which is this fold's own admitted count, so
 * the determinism established here is what it counts against. What is left
 * order-dependent there is one sketchbook's several simultaneous parcel claims,
 * not the town's standing estate.
 */
/**
 * THE CLAIM COMPARATOR. Earlier claim first; ties break on the whole id.
 *
 * BY PARSED INSTANT, NOT BY STRING, and that is a correctness fix rather than a
 * preference. `isValidMarkDate` accepts a UTC OFFSET — `2026-07-23T14:30:00+05:30`
 * is one of its own accepted forms — and that instant is 2026-07-23T09:00Z, which
 * a string comparison sorts AFTER `2026-07-23T10:00:00Z`. Lexicographic order is

 *
 * A BARE DAY PARSES TO ITS MIDNIGHT UTC, so `2026-09-01` sorts before every
 * stamped claim on 2026-09-01. That is deliberate: the bare form is the older
 * door's shape, its hour is unknown, and treating an unknown hour as the
 * earliest is the reading that leaves standing ground standing.
 *
 * UNPARSEABLE dates fall back to the string, then to the id, so the comparator
 * is total and never returns NaN into a sort. A mark with no date at all sorts
 * first, which matches how `> PARCEL_CAP_LAW_DATE` already treats it: an absent

// ── WAS THIS REGISTRY VERIFIED AGAINST THE LIVE TOWN, THIS CROSSING? ─────────
//                                                     (founder, 2026-09-09)
//
//   "please make sure this incident cannot happen again by construction."
//
// The incident: `WORLD/households.json` sat 33 days behind the town while this
// fold, the lint and the authorship wall read it as live. Refreshing it every
// crossing (postmark-office `deploy/settlement-auto.sh`) is the mechanism; this
// is the construction that makes the mechanism's absence visible.
//
// ── THE FIRST CUT ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION, AND IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE
//    TOWN (caught in review, 2026-09-09) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// It demanded the registry's `town_sha` EQUAL the sha the crossing pinned. But
// the export writes the file only when the MAPPING moved — `generated_at` and
// `town_sha` are deliberately excluded from that comparison, so a registry
// nothing changed keeps its older stamp. The town takes 150-300 commits a day,
// so two crossings never pin the same sha. Every crossing after a quiet one
// would have refused, and the town would have settled only on the days somebody
// joined. The export's own header states the sentence that refutes it: "an older
// `town_sha` means the mapping has not changed since — never that nobody
// looked."
//
// ── THE QUESTION THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING ASKED ────────────────────────────────
//
// Freshness is not "the stamp equals my sha". It is "somebody checked this file
// against the live town on this crossing". That is a fact only the OFFICE knows,
// because the office is the side holding the town clone. So the office STATES
// it and this side checks the statement:
//
//   { verifiedAt: <sha> }   the refresh ran, re-derived the registry from the
//                           town at <sha>, and either rewrote this file or found
//                           it already correct. FRESH, whatever stamp it carries.
//   { unverified: <reason>} the operator deliberately skipped the refresh
//                           (SETTLEMENT_REGISTRY=0). NEVER a refusal — a
//                           documented bypass that refuses is not a bypass — and
//                           the caller says so LOUDLY on the receipt.
//   null                    no crossing context: a hand run, or the isolation
//                           pass re-running a crossing whose registry this same
//                           line already cleared. Not armed, exactly as before.
//
// WHAT THIS SIDE CAN STILL CATCH, and it is worth being honest that it is
// narrow: a caller claiming VERIFIED over a registry the export has never
// written. Such a file carries no `town_sha` at all — that is the 2026-08-07
// file exactly — and a claim of verification over it is a claim that cannot be
// true, because a verified registry is a written one (postmark-office
// `deploy/settlement-registry.mjs` writes whenever the prior file is unstamped,
// so "verified" implies "stamped" by construction on that side).
//
// The real refusal for a crossing that could not verify happens where the town
// actually is: the office chain refuses before it ever reaches the sweep.

  //
  // THE INVARIANT, and the whole reason it can be trusted as a display change:
  //     own_escrow + breadth.bonus + Σ fanned[].weight === weight
  // exactly. It holds by construction — own_escrow + bonus is precisely what
  // the stake loop put in weightByMark, and fanned re-reads the same memoized
  // child totals weightOf already summed — and tools/weight-parts.test.mjs
  // re-checks it over the whole real fold rather than trusting the argument.
  //
  // Read AFTER the loop above, never during it: `weight` is only complete for
  // every id once every weightOf has returned, and a decomposition built
  // mid-traversal would quietly report a partial subtree.
  //
  // Shaped so a later term slots in as one more component beside `breadth`
  // (a fan-DOWN share, say) without disturbing the two that exist.

  // uniform shape reads `mk.weight_parts ?? ZERO_PARTS`; a reader wanting the

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE DELTA ADMISSION — §4's "validate only its delta against that folded state"
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The world-runtime ladder, §4, verbatim:
//
//   "Today the sweep folds each of ~27 sketchbooks against the whole world
//    (`foldRef`): ~28 whole-world O(m²) folds per settlement. Target: fold main
//    ONCE; per sketchbook, validate only its delta (`markDelta` already computes
//    it) against that folded state — O(k·m) per branch; keep ONE full fold of
//    the merged result as the final gate."
//
// Measured before this was written (part 1, on a throwaway clone of the live
// record): 24 whole-world folds of 940 marks, 176.7 s, to adjudicate 37 delta
// rows. This function is what replaces 23 of those folds.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS ALLOWED TO DECIDE, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ────────────────────────
//
// It answers exactly the two questions the sweep asked its per-branch fold:
//
//   1. is this sketchbook admissible — or does it quarantine?
//   2. what is the FOLDED VIEW of each mark it is publishing?
//
// It does NOT answer contests, weights, rivalries or canon. Those are the
// merged fold's, which still runs as the final gate exactly as §4 says, so
// cross-household composition surfaces there as it always did.
//
// ── THE FOUNDER'S SENTENCE, AND WHAT IT CHANGES ─────────────────────────────
//
// Ruled 2026-08-24: "the crossing judges what a household publishes, not what
// its stale tree happens to contain."
//
// That is the whole licence for the scope below. Today a sketchbook is folded as
// ITS OWN TREE, so a malformed row anywhere in it — including a row the
// household is not publishing, and including rows that are simply 115 crossings
// stale — quarantines the household. Under this function only the CANDIDATES are
// judged. A household whose stale tree carries residue now settles; a household
// whose PUBLISHED delta is genuinely bad still refuses, by name. Both halves are
// pinned in tools/settlement-delta.test.mjs.
//
// ── THE FOLDED VIEW IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A raw record is not a view. `markStanding` walks a mark's ancestry looking for
// `kind === "parcel" || sovereign`, and a raw record carries neither `sovereign`
// nor `placementParent` — so a mark standing on its author's own ground reads
// "market" where the whole-world fold reads "home". Part 1 found that with a
// can-fail flip before any of this existed. The three derived fields are
// reproduced here, each from the fold's own rule above:
//
//   declared_household   the household grain (§ the household grain)
//   sovereign            inside any parcel rect the same CRED holds
//   placementParent      the loader's directory edge, which the record already
//                        carries from its path
//
// Nothing else is derived, because nothing else is read: the sweep's only
// consumer of the view is `classifyMark(view, folded)`.
