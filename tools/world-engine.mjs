// world-engine.mjs — THE semantic-world library for Postmark.
//
// One library, four capabilities the spine verbs wrap thinly:
//   1. heightfield   — naive elevation over the seventeen ruled region bands
//   2. spatial query — index marks + terrain by position; ray-march the ground
//   3. FOV           — line-of-sight over the heightfield, honoring fog / light
//   4. radial serializer — visible marks as quantized bearings + named bands,
//                          ranked by angular size modulated by stamps (LOD)
//
// This is a PURE library: it consumes already-loaded, already-folded, already-
// lint-validated marks. It reads no marks from disk and defines no containment —
// the ONE loader and ONE `contains` live in marks-fold.mjs (shared with
// mark-lint.mjs, the 07-22 nesting gate). A second reader/geometry here would
// reintroduce the exact drift that design closes.
//
// What you "see" IS the marks tree (the paradigm, epic § The semantic world).
// Render cost is capped by a CONTEXT BUDGET, never proportional to world size:
// the FOV ranks every candidate but the telling carries only the top-budget,
// with the rest collapsed into an aggregate tail.
//
// LAWS THIS OBEYS (Wright's brief, decision 008, MARKS.md):
//   • Elevation derives from residents' words + the rulings, NEVER drawn pixels.
//     The bands are decision 008's; the region anchors are extracted from placed
//     homes + terrain features by the loader, not painted.
//   • Every numeric lean is a DIAL — in DIALS below or in the skeleton/config,
//     movable by ruling, never silently. (See WORLD/ENGINE.md for the table.)
//   • Deterministic and replayable from any clone: no wall-clock, no unseeded
//     randomness. Fog weather seeds from the crossing number (fogModel).
//   • Geometry is the authority; a declared edge that contradicts coordinates is
//     refused upstream by mark-lint.mjs ("you cannot lie with an edge"), which
//     shares the fold's one `contains`. The engine consumes validated marks.
//
// TWO LESSONS CARRIED (Jetto, budding-friendship build, 2026-07-22):
//   • Retroactive-replay hazard: a lean living in a code CONSTANT re-decides
//     history the day the constant changes. So the leans that could change a
//     past crossing's telling (fog model, band thresholds) are DIALS read from
//     config, and fog is a pure function of the crossing number — replay of
//     crossing N is byte-identical by construction, not by a guard.
//   • Law-line supersession: the light axis and Evermoon's west-move are
//     "provisional on caelum's word." A superseding ruling must RESTATE what it
//     carries forward (the anchors), the way a new rules-version restates the
//     meep set — it may not silently drop a pole. The engine reads light/terrain
//     as dated config so a supersession is a dated event, not a quiet flip.
//
// Pure library: no I/O here except reading is done by callers. Import `fold`
// from marks-fold.mjs (the canon computation) upstream; this consumes its output.

  // bucketed into square cells, and a sample walks rings of cells outward from
  // its own until the K it holds are CLOSER than anything a further ring could
  // contain — then stops. A sample far from every cell (the outliers sit 96 km
  // out) runs out of rings and takes the full scan, which is the old answer.
  //
  // THE ANSWER MUST NOT MOVE BY A BIT, and the reason it cannot is the stop
  // rule. A point left unvisited is at least the ring's edge away, and the
  // search only stops when the K-th distance held is strictly inside that edge
  // (with a margin for the edge's own rounding) — so every point that could sit
  // in the K, or tie with its last seat, was visited. Visiting order is by cell
  // rather than by index, so ties are broken on the INDEX explicitly: the same
  // (distance, index) order the stable sort kept, and the same order the full
  // scan's strict comparisons keep. heightfield-selection.test.mjs holds both

// occluded by the ground it sits on, and more so the further off it is, which
