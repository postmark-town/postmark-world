// lately-on-the-resident-path.test.mjs — the Lately pane, asked of a page that
// is actually signed in (2026-09-13).
//
// ── WHY A PAGE RIG, WHEN `recentActivity` IS ALREADY UNIT-TESTED ───────────
//
// `tools/viewer-axes.test.mjs` asks `recentActivity` eight ways and every one of
// them passes on the broken build, because the bug is not in that function. It
// is in what `renderActivity` FEEDS it:
//
//     marks: world?.marks ?? data?.worldState?.marks ?? []
//
// `applyWorldLayer` sets BOTH of those to null on the resident path, by design
// and with its reason written beside it, so a signed-in reader is handed the
// empty array. The settlement rows survive (they come from `settleState.recent`)
// and the "wrote" rows vanish — which is exactly the shape Keemin reported:
// Lately showing settlements and no residents. Measured on dev before its office
// went down: spectator 3 settlements + 11 mark rows, signed in as rei 14
// settlements + 0 mark rows.
//
// A function that is handed the wrong argument cannot be caught by testing the
// function. Only the wiring can be asked, and only a mounted DOM can answer —
// the lesson `tools/town-ground-page.test.mjs` was written after and states at
// length. This is that file's sibling for the resident path, which until now no
// test in this repo has ever driven in a browser. Three bugs of this exact class
// are recorded in the viewer's own comments (the 89-card detour, the stale
// `byId` on the way out, and this one); not one of them was visible to a unit
// test.
//
// ── WHAT MAKES THIS THE RESIDENT PATH AND NOT A COSTUME ────────────────────
//
// `onResidentPath()` is `identityResolved() && !isSpectating() && !!state.handle`,
// so the page has to be genuinely signed in. A stub office answers the three
// doors that takes — `/ops/whoami`, `/world/my-marks`, `/world/apex` — and the
// viewer reaches it through `pm.office.base`, which `officeBase()` reads from
// localStorage. Nothing is mocked inside the page: the real viewer makes real
// requests and the real `loadResidentRead` fills `byId` from the answer.
//
// THE READ CARRIES MARKS THE FOLD DOES NOT. Every record below is invented and
// its id is unmistakable, so the central assertion can be a RELATION rather than
// a count: on the resident path every "wrote" row must name a mark THE READ
// carried. That is unsatisfiable by the fold — before the fix there are no mark
// rows at all, and if a later change ever let the town's 1,218 marks leak back
// onto this path the same assertion reds from the other side. A bare count would
// have missed that second failure entirely.
//
// THE PRECONDITION IS THE OFFICE'S OWN RECORD OF BEING ASKED. Before any claim
// is made about the pane, this file proves the read actually landed AND was
// consumed: `mountWalkers` only reaches `/world/present?x=..&y=..` when the read
// is in the cache and carries a standpoint, and the coordinates in that URL are
// the ones THIS FIXTURE invented. A stub asked for the standpoint it made up is
// not a thing a spectator page, or a resident page whose read failed, can
// produce. A falsifier that cannot tell "the fix is wrong" from "the read never
// arrived" is not measuring the fix — and on the first run of this file that is
// exactly what the precondition caught.
//
// (The first draft waited for a WALKER to be drawn instead. It cannot be: this
// rig runs with the atlas unreachable, `drawWalkers` returns immediately without
// a mounted map, and the wait simply timed out — a precondition that fails for a
// reason unrelated to the thing under test. The office's record needs no map.)
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// In `renderActivity`, restore the old source:
//
//     marks: world?.marks ?? data?.worldState?.marks ?? [],
//
// The signed-in test reds on "showed NO mark rows". Run receipt in
// docs/2026-09-12/jetto-world-page-report.md § Piece 10.
