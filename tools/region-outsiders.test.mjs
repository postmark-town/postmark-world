// WHAT BROKE (S45's seventh refusal, 2026-08-24). The list was written by
// tools/region-rings-gen.mjs, hand-run against the atlas. The settlement sweep
// publishes marks and performs re-homes and is not hand-run, so the 13:51Z
// attempt moved the record and left the list where it was — and the
// biconditional every heads-up rests on ("either contained or listed, never
// neither, never both") was false for anything the settlement had touched.
//
// The list is now derived at every fold. These falsifiers hold the property that
// failure taught: not "the list is correct today" but "the list cannot be stale
// after the world changes", which is a claim about WHEN it is written.
//
