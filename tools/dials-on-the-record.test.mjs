// dials-on-the-record.test.mjs — the two rulings of 2026-08-22, asserted
// against the FOLDED WORLD, not a fixture.
//
// WHY THE LIVE FOLD AND NOT A FIXTURE. The slow-walk bug (PSA 2026-08-22) was
// not a wrong formula: every unit test passed while every walker in the world
// moved at a quarter of the lawful stride for five days, because the reader
// asked for a class named `departure` that had been renamed to `depart` and a
// fixture happily answered to whichever name the fixture itself used. A test
// that builds its own record can only ever prove the code agrees with the test.
// So these read WORLD/world-state.json — what a clone actually folds — and a
// dial that is renamed, re-parented, or dropped goes red here.
//
// Run: node --test tools/
