// settlement-delta.test.mjs — THE EQUIVALENCE GATE for §4's delta folds.
//
// The world-runtime ladder, §4, verbatim:
//
//   "Today the sweep folds each of ~27 sketchbooks against the whole world
//    (`foldRef`): ~28 whole-world O(m²) folds per settlement. Target: fold main
//    ONCE; per sketchbook, validate only its delta (`markDelta` already computes
//    it) against that folded state — O(k·m) per branch; keep ONE full fold of
//    the merged result as the final gate. ~28 full folds → ~1 + 27 cheap checks.
//    Cross-household composition (two drafts conflicting only with each other)
//    surfaces at the merged fold, as now."
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS BEFORE THE OPTIMIZATION DOES ────────────────────────
//
// The two paths do NOT fold the same world, and that is not a subtlety — it is
// the whole risk. Today each sketchbook is folded as ITS OWN TREE. Measured on a
// throwaway clone of the live record (2026-08-23, world main a1f08ea7): every
// one of the 23 live sketchbooks is ~115 marks BEHIND main. So "validate the
// delta against main's folded state" judges each sketchbook against a world
// with 115 marks its own tree does not contain.
//
// That could move a verdict. `markStanding` walks a mark's ancestry to find its
// governing ground, and 115 extra marks is 115 more chances for that walk to
// stop somewhere else. Whether it DOES move one is a question of fact, and the
// answer belongs in a test rather than in a hope.
//
// So this file asserts the property §4's optimization needs and does not
// currently have a name for: FOR EVERY DELTA ROW, THE VERDICT IS THE SAME
// WHICHEVER WORLD IT WAS DERIVED IN. A perf slice that changes one verdict is
// not a perf slice, and this is the gate that says so out loud.
//
// ── THE LIVE MEASUREMENT THIS ENCODES ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Run against a throwaway clone of postmark-world at main a1f08ea7, with the
// live escrow reproduced from main's own world-state (101 staked marks):
//
//   24 whole-world folds (main + 23 sketchbooks), 940 marks each
//   main's fold alone            11.5 s
//   all 24 folds                176.7 s   ← of a 363.7 s settlement
//   per sketchbook               ~6.8 s = archive 1.0 + loadMarks 1.8 + fold 4.0
//   delta rows across ALL 23      37
//   verdict equivalence          37 / 37 agree, 0 divergences
//
// Thirty-seven rows, adjudicated by a hundred and seventy-seven seconds of
// folding. That is the case for §4, measured rather than estimated — and the
// 37/37 is the green light this gate exists to keep green.
