// mine-stands-out.test.mjs — your parcels and your people, told louder than the
// rest of the town (2026-09-13).
//
// Keemin: "we need YOUR residents and their parcels to stand out on the page,
// even at far zoom. let's make them bigger than the others and always 'pinned'
// as if they are clicked (need a similar thing for residents — walk paths
// visible too, from any distance)."
//
// ── THE THREE CLAIMS, AND THE ONE THAT IS EASY TO FAKE ─────────────────────
//
//   1. your parcels draw their CARD at town width, where the town draws beads
//   2. a mark you merely BACKED is not yours and stays a bead
//   3. your household's unfinished walks are drawn, clipped to the painting
//
// (2) is the one a careless implementation gets wrong and no eye would catch:
// `state.mineIds` — the set that decides what is DRAWN — includes backed marks,
// correctly, because a mark you staked is one you should be able to see. It is
// not one you own. Measured on dev: rei backs 22 marks, 19 of them placed. So
// there is a second, narrower set, and this file asserts the difference from
// both sides at once — the owned parcel loud, the backed parcel ordinary, in the
// same page, in the same frame.
//
// ── WHY THE WALK IS SEEDED AND NOT WAITED FOR ──────────────────────────────
//
// Measured on dev while designing this: the office reports 50 walkers out and
// ZERO moving. A test that waits for a real walk waits forever. So the rig
// intercepts `/WORLD/walk-ledger.md` — same-origin by law, `record-sources.mjs`
// gives it no office route — and serves two departures of its own.
//
// Both are dated at a crossing the clock has not reached. That is deliberate and
// it is the only deterministic way to hold a walk in progress: `positionAt`
// takes `elapsed = max(0, now - at)`, so an unreached departure puts the walker
// at its origin with the whole leg ahead and `arrived` false, and it stays that
// way whatever day this test is run. A departure timed in the past would arrive
// within the hour and the file would rot.
//
// The second departure starts at (-94570, -94570) — the real origin the seeding
// gave 28 residents, 133,749 m from a painting 7,500 m across. It is here as the
// ugliest case the clip has to survive, at the reviewer's request.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIPS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   `const mine = false;` in homeCard          → claims 1 and 2's first half red
//   `state.ownIds = state.mineIds;`            → claim 2 reds (backed goes loud)
//   `return "";` at the top of walkPathsSVG    → claim 3 reds
//
// Run receipts in docs/2026-09-12/jetto-world-page-report.md.
