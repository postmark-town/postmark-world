// Several fixtures build a throwaway repo and run `marks-fold.mjs` or
// `mark-lint.mjs` inside it as a real subprocess (which is the point: they test
// the tool a resident's crossing actually runs, not an in-process stand-in).
// Each of them used to carry its OWN hand-written list of files to copy, eight
// copies of the same fact — so the day marks-fold.mjs gained an import, six
// fixtures failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND in a temp directory and none of
// them was wrong about anything the world does.
//
// One list, imported. Add a module to the engine's import graph and add it
// here; there is no second place that has to be found.
