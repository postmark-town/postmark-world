// viewer-stood-out.test.mjs — THE CAMERA STEPS OUTSIDE WHEN THE EXIT DOES.
//
// ⚑ FOUNDER, 2026-08-29: he exited as rei, the door took it, and he was still
// looking at the inside of the vault. The scene is mounted off the enter-exit
// ledger, which is read on a clock, so between the act landing and the next
// read the page went on drawing a room its reader had left. The stale entry
// IS cleaned up, but only in the OUTDOORS branch of the telling's render, which
// never runs in painting-only mode: the default, and the mode he was in.
//
// The site's cockpit knows the moment the door takes an exit and says so on
// `pm:stood-out` (site: src/lib/world-cockpit-mount.mjs). The viewer listens,
// drops the built interior for that standpoint, puts the town back, and asks
// the record to catch up behind the redraw.
//
// SOURCE PINS, the repo's discipline for closure code inside mountViewer (the
// pattern entered-mark-chip.test.mjs keeps). Built on the party lineage (world
// 9120587c), lost in the 08-29 rollback, ported 2026-09-16 (POS-91 /
// postmark#2847) without the room's music, which stayed with the dungeon.
