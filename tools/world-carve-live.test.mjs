// world-carve-live.test.mjs — the falsifiers, run against THE REAL WORLD.
//
// Everything in determination.test.mjs and consent.test.mjs is a two-rectangle
// fixture, which is how you check that a rule says what you think it says. This
// file checks something else: that the rule, turned loose on every mark the
// town has actually made, moves EXACTLY what was predicted and nothing else.
//
// Escrow comes from WORLD/fixtures/stakes-2026-08-10.json — the town's own
// derived export (`node tools/world-stake.mjs --escrow --json` in a town clone at
// keeminlee/postmark 8a31403, re-derived byte-identical at 0ca018d), pinned here
// so this file can fail. Folded with zero escrow every weight is zero, every
// assertion below is vacuous, and the test would pass while proving nothing.
//
// The household grain comes from WORLD/fixtures/households-declared-2026-08-10.json
// — handle → DECLARED HOUSEHOLD SLUG, projected by tools/households-project.mjs
// from the town's own tools/households.json.
//
// ── AND THE CREDENTIAL GRAIN IS NOW A FIXTURE TOO (2026-09-09) ──────────────
//
// It used to be read live, out of WORLD/households.json, because that file WAS
// the credential grain: the 2026-08-07 export, keyed by credential id, filing one
// household's two accounts as strangers. Two tests below asserted exactly that,
// against the live file.
//
// Which made them instruments that measured their own placement. The moment the
// settlement crossing began re-deriving that file every crossing (postmark-office
// deploy/settlement-auto.sh, 2026-09-09), the shipped registry stopped being
// purely credential-keyed — `hh:<house>` keys arrived for declared houses — and
// both tests went red BECAUSE THE DEFECT THEY NAMED HAD BEEN REPAIRED. A control
// that reddens when its subject is fixed is not a control.
//
// So the credential grain is pinned beside the declared one, as
// WORLD/fixtures/households-credential-2026-08-07.json, with its source stamped
// in the file. The two halves are then the same population from the same week,
// which is the state these tests were written in and passed in.
//
// WHY NOT REGENERATE BOTH FROM TODAY'S TOWN, which is the obvious other move:
// there is no live credential grain left to regenerate from. The refreshed file
// is MIXED — `gh:` for pinned households, `hh:` for declared houses — so
// regenerating only the declared half would leave the pair two different
// populations apart, which is the exact shape that reddened them (the 2026-08-10
// fixture does not know `alta-of-garrison`, who joined later, so the Garrison
// read as split).
//
// What the LIVE file is still held to is a RELATION, gated by its own stamp
// rather than by a date written here — see § THE CADAEIC CASE.

  // sharpest of them by name: `overLimen`, where the ground class law had taken
  // from limen went back to limen. That contest no longer exists. Constitution
  // ground binds without stamps and cannot be rivaled, so the fold filters the
  // Centre out of the carve before it runs (`commonsSited`) and it now appears
  // in NO contest at all — a stronger form of this test's own claim, not a
  // weaker one: a region that takes nothing for being one, and is not even at
  // the table.
  //
  // What matters is that nobody's ground moved to make that true, which is
  // checked here rather than asserted in prose. The Centre leaves the overlay
  // entirely; so do the ten marks whose only rival was the Centre (four of
  // little-bird's and six of the town's own) — an ABSENT overlay entry means a
  // mark holds its whole claim UNCONTESTED, never that it lost it. The one
  // resident whose numbers change, changes upward.
