// town-ground.test.mjs — the falsifier for "all world visuals are from the world".
//
// Founder, 2026-09-08: "no more atlas background, all world visuals are from the
// world." `townGround()` answers it. This is the assertion that the answer is
// true, and the hard part is choosing an assertion that CAN FAIL.
//
// A SCREENSHOT DIFF WOULD PASS ON A HARDCODED RING. So would "the page paints",
// and so would "the ground contains twelve polygons". Each of those confirms
// that something was drawn; none of them asks where the numbers came from. The
// question is provenance, so the test reads provenance:
//
//   1. EVERY drawn element names a source in `data-src`, and the only elements
//      exempt are the sheet itself (paper, rule wash) and what sits in <defs>.
//      A new hardcoded shape has no source and reddens here.
//   2. Every source RESOLVES against the record — a mark id that the marks
//      index holds, a feature id skeleton.features holds, a night enclave
//      skeleton.light holds, or the day axis with both its poles present. An
//      invented source reddens here.
//   3. Every mark-sourced polygon MATCHES the mark it names — vertex for vertex,
//      projected back through the registration into metres, to the ground's
//      own grain (it writes a tenth of a px; 0.25 m at 5 m per px). This is
//      the one with teeth: a ring copied out of the atlas and labelled with a
//      mark's id passes (1) and (2) and dies here, and so does a ring that stops
//      tracking a region the record has since moved.
//
// (3) is deliberately a BACK-PROJECTION rather than a re-derivation. Re-deriving
// the ground and comparing it to itself is an identity assertion, which is the
// defect this lane's own carry names: verifying a claim and watching it are two
// acts, and only the second is a test. Back-projection compares two independent
// things — what the svg says, and what the record says.

  // ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS TEST. It is a source-text regex, and a
  // regex proves a line was TYPED — never that its value reaches the screen.
  // The fresh reviewer kept this exact call site, discarded its answer, mounted
  // a blank sheet, and every assertion in this file stayed green. It is brittle
  // the other way too: reordering `mountScene`'s arguments reds it while nothing
  // about the page has changed.
  //
  // THE REAL GUARD IS `tools/town-ground-page.test.mjs`, which boots the rig and
  // counts what is actually on the mounted ground. This one is kept because it
  // costs nothing and it still runs where Playwright is absent — which is the
  // one condition in which the real guard silently stops watching.
  //
  // The bug it was written for: this lane's first call site passed `data.marks`.
  // `data` is { trueWorld, myWorld, worldState, skeleton, manifest } and there
  // is no `marks` on it. Every other assertion in this file stayed green,
  // because each one hands `townGround` the marks itself and none of them asked
  // what the PAGE hands it. A falsifier that supplies its own input cannot watch
  // the wiring.
  // the CALL, not the declaration (`export function townGround(marks, …)` sits
  // 4,000 lines above it and matches a lazier pattern — the first version of
  // this assertion caught the definition and reported `marks`)
  // ⚑ THE CALL SITE MOVED ON 2026-09-10 and this guard went red, correctly:
  // it is a source-text regex and the source text changed. The ground now reads
  // `allMarks()`, which is the assembled fold where there is one and — on the
  // resident path, which loads no fold at all — the read's own `records`,
  // carrying the town's ground set for exactly this call. The guard follows the
  // call site; it does not get to hold it still.
  //
  // The regex now accepts a CALL as well as a dotted name, because the first
  // version could only see `world.marks` and a lane that swapped in an accessor
  // reported "loadMinimap calls townGround" — a failure about the regex wearing
  // the costume of a failure about the page.
