// gates the law names (§6, below): *an existing mark directory that moves is
// refused*, and *a new mark files at its id*. Containment is no longer asked of
// the tree at all; it is derived at the fold and emitted as WORLD/containment.json.

// What stood here until 2026-08-25 was the tightest-container check: the
// directory edge had to name the smallest mark that geometrically contained the
// record, and a drifted edge was either a refusal or a re-home. The founder
// repealed it (LOGOS/state-and-time.md § "The freeze — filing is static, and the
// tree is a fossil"):
//
//   "The directory-matches-containment law is REPEALED — the tree's paths make
//    no assertion, so nothing about them can become false. The lint's old
//    dir-equals-placementParent check dies with it; in its place stand two gates
//    that enforce the freeze itself: *an existing mark directory that moves is
//    refused*, and *a new mark files at its id*."
//
// Every receipt of friction the old check produced — the publish+re-home wedge,
// stranded sketchbooks, stale outsider lists, twenty-seven dead registry paths —
// came from one property: paths that moved under readers. These two gates take
// that property away rather than policing its consequences. Nothing here asks
// where a mark STANDS; that question is the fold's, answered at every settlement
// in WORLD/containment.json.
//
// THE MANIFEST IS THE FOSSIL'S BOUNDARY. WORLD/filing-freeze.json was minted
// once, on the freeze date, mapping every mark then alive to the path it was
// filed at. It is never regenerated: a rebuild would re-bless whatever the tree
// happened to say that day, which is the one thing the freeze exists to prevent.
// An id IN the manifest is a fossil and answers gate A; an id NOT in it was born
// after the freeze and answers gate B, needing no row, because its path is
