// constitution-tier data.
//
// RE-DERIVED 2026-07-22 (survey decision 008; Keemin: "land and re-derive").
// The first version hardcoded channel waypoints mirrored from the 07-17
// renderer — and the 07-21/22 atlas-v2 passes (river re-cut, Long Run onto the
// main channel, Still Reach pool, Evermoon west) stranded every mirror. This
// version EXTRACTS the water constants from the atlas's own render-town.mjs
// text and reads its terrain-candidate-A.json, so a future atlas pass either
// flows through mechanically or fails loud here — duplication drifts,
// extraction can't (fix the class, not the instance).
//
// Usage: node tools/world-terrain-gen.mjs [--atlas <dir>]
//   --atlas defaults to this repo's own PROJECTS/build-the-town/atlas copy;
//   point it at the live clone's atlas dir for a fresh derive. The source
//   used is printed loudly either way.
