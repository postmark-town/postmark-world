/**
 * WHAT WAS THERE TO LOOK AT — derived the OTHER way (2026-08-27, the loud-empty
 * guard).
 *
 * The sweep's own reading of a sketchbook goes `draftBranches` → `markDelta` →
 * the three-readings supersession logic → candidates. That path is where a
 * starving crossing comes from: on 2026-08-25 and 08-26 it returned nothing at
 * all while sketchbooks held escrowed marks, and the crossing exited 0 green
 * twice a day for two days because "I found no candidates" and "there were no
 * candidates" print identically.
 *
 * This is the second opinion, and it is deliberately built from DIFFERENT
 * primitives: raw `for-each-ref` over both local and remote draft refs (not
 * `draftBranches`, which creates tracking branches and could itself be the
 * thing returning an empty list), and a raw `git diff --name-only` against main
 * (not `markDelta`, whose supersession reading is the subtlest code in this
 * file). It answers exactly one question — "is any sketchbook holding a mark
 * that the town has staked stamps behind" — and it has no vote on what should
 * publish. Only the CONTRADICTION is actionable: the crossing found nothing on
 * every channel, and this found something with escrow behind it.
 *
 * A survey that agrees with a zero crossing is the receipt that the quiet pass
 * was quiet because the town was quiet.
 *
 * ── WHOSE SKETCHBOOKS THESE ARE, UNDER A STORE CROSSING (2026-09-09) ────────
 *
 * That last sentence is a claim about the git era, and it does not carry across
 * on its own. On the office train's `SETTLEMENT_SOURCE=store` path the record
 * lives in the store, and the office does not hand this survey a smaller world
 * — it deletes every draft ref and then BUILDS one local sketchbook per
 * household before the sweep runs (`src/store-writedown.mjs`, in the office
 * repo, whose own words for these branches are "a scratch surface this crossing
 * makes for the sweep to read"). So a store crossing that carries anything
 * gives this survey `branches ≥ 1`, and the numbers below count surfaces the
 * crossing made seconds earlier rather than a register of work that was
 * waiting.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE, and it should not try: a ref count is
 * not an era, and the store path deliberately keeps it non-zero. The mode is
 * known in exactly one place — the office receipt, which reads it from
 * `SETTLEMENT_SOURCE_MODE` and carries it as `source:` beside these very counts
 * — and that is where the distinction belongs. Do not infer the era here.
 * (Measured against office `train/2026-w38` @ `a2bac38`; an earlier pass of
 * this lane inferred it from `branches === 0` and was wrong twice — that state
 * is unreachable on a carrying store crossing, and in the git era it is an
 * honestly quiet town.)

  // crossing by name." That rule compared the file's stamp to the crossing's pin
  // for EQUALITY, and the export rewrites the file only when the mapping moves
  // while the town takes 150-300 commits a day — so it refused every crossing
  // after a quiet one, and the town would have settled only on the days somebody
  // joined. What survives of it is narrow and is stated at the call below: a

  // CHECKED HERE, AND ALSO IN `foldRefInner`. The second call is not redundant
