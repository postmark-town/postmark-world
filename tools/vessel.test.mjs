//   node --test tools/vessel.test.mjs
//
// The law under test (Keemin, 2026-08-11): position = f(walk ledger, timetable,
// agreements, clock). BOARDING-IS-PRESENCE IS RETIRED — an entity is moved by a
// mark only by its own agreement, so a ride is a written record and everything
// else about it stays derived. Every clone recomputes the same voyage from the
// same four inputs, so these tests pass a clock in rather than reading one.
//
// WHAT THE RE-PIN CHANGED, and what it deliberately did not. Every test below
// that used to prove someone was collected now hands `positionAt` an agreement
// and proves the same voyage; every test that used to prove someone was NOT
// collected now proves it for a stronger reason — no agreement — and the
// geometry those refusals leaned on is asserted to be irrelevant rather than
// removed, because the whole content of the ruling is that standing somewhere
// is not consent. The schedule, the run, the deposit point and the wharf grant
// are untouched: this is a change to who may be moved, not to where she goes.
//
// The tree is read ONCE here to build the real folded world; every derivation
// below is a pure function of that object. That is deliberate: the service that
// sails on Sunday is the one these tests derive, not a fixture that resembles it.
//
// THE RULE OF THIS SUITE (2026-08-09): no assertion here contains a stop's
// literal coordinates, nor a leg length or a run time computed from them. The
// landing moved 1216 m onto Porch Hill by ruling, the wheelhouse's timetable did
// not need one edit — and five tests went red anyway, because they carried a
// written-down copy of the coordinate the design refuses to duplicate. A suite
// that reddens on the one operation the mechanic exists to make cheap is
// guarding the wrong thing. So every expected position, leg and duration below
// is READ FROM THE FOLD, and every instant that depends on how long a crossing
// takes is derived from the sailing it belongs to. Re-site a stop and these
// tests re-time themselves.
