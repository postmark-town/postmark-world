// lately-reads-the-store.test.mjs — the Lately pane's two bugs, asked of a real
// page (POS-84, 2026-09-16). Sibling of `lately-on-the-resident-path.test.mjs`
// and it borrows that file's rig wholesale; read its header for why a page rig
// is the only thing that can answer a wiring question.
//
// ── CAUSE B — THE WALK LANE HAS BEEN DEAD SINCE 2026-08-10 ─────────────────
//
// `loadWalkLedger` read `/WORLD/walk-ledger.md` and nothing else. That file
// FROZE on 2026-08-10T20:25Z by its own seam line ("the walk ledger freezes
// with honor") and every departure since lives in the store. Measured on prod
// 2026-09-16: `/api/world2/walks` held 2,498 departures — 348 in the last four
// days — and Lately could show none of them. The map's walkers were never
// affected; they read `/world/walkers`, which is live.
//
// So the office goes first, `?since=` a fortnight back, and the frozen file
// stays as the fallback. The test below gives the stub office ONE departure,
// dated today, by a handle that could not have come from anywhere else — the
// frozen file has nothing from this decade's last five weeks, so a pane naming
// that handle read the store and nothing else could have put it there.
//
// ── CAUSE A — THE FIRST LIST WAS DRAWN TO BE THROWN AWAY ───────────────────
//
// Three lanes fed the pane and each painted the moment it landed. The walk
// ledger is 43 KB and always landed first, so the first list a reader saw was
// departures alone, and departures alone cannot survive the sort once anything
// else is in hand. Measured on prod 2026-09-15, signed in as the keeminlee
// household: 14 rows at 13.0 s, every one a "set out"; at 17.5 s all 14
// replaced. A spectator saw a smaller version of the same thing — first list at
// 4.5 s, one row swapped at 5.9 s.
//
// The fix is one render when the lanes settle, plus `renderActivity()` in
// `loadResidentRead`'s callback, plus a pane that stays hidden until that first
// settled render.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ABOUT THAT, AND THE ONE PLACE IT IS NARROWER THAN THE
// BRIEF. The brief asks that "the first non-empty render of `.wv-acts` equals
// its render after network-idle". That is asserted verbatim on the SPECTATOR
// path, where the three lanes are everything the pane will ever be fed. It is
// NOT literally true on the resident path and cannot be made so without gating
// the pane on the resident read as well, which is a different change: the
// resident's own marks arrive on a fourth lane, after, and they are an ADDITION
// — the bug was a wholesale replacement. So the resident path is asked the
// property the brief's own parenthetical names — "no row appears that a later
// lane removes" — plus the sharper one that actually catches the bug: the first
// list must already carry every lane, never departures alone.
//
// (The subset claim is rig-scoped on purpose and says so at its assertion: the
// pane caps at 14 rows, so on a busy town a later arrival CAN legitimately push
// an older row off the end. This rig stays well under the cap, so a row that
// vanishes here vanished because something replaced it.)
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIPS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both were run on the committed tree, 2026-09-16, and both reds are quoted
// below verbatim — the receipt is here, not behind a pointer.
//
//   1. Restore the ledger-only source — `recordSources("/WORLD/walk-ledger.md")`
//      with no `office:`. 3 of 5 red; the first is the precondition, which is
//      the honest place for it to fail, because with no office leg the door is
//      never asked at all:
//
//        not ok 1 - THE WALK LANE READS THE STORE — a departure from today reaches the pane
//          error: |-
//            the page never asked the office for walks at all: ["/world/skeleton",
//            "/world/state","/world/settlements","/repo/log?limit=120",
//            "/world/enter-exit-ledger","/world/walkers","/walks"]
//
//   2. Restore the three independent renders — `loadWalkLedger().then(renderActivity)`,
//      `loadSettlements().then(() => { renderSettlementChip(); renderActivity(); })`,
//      `loadStakeEvents().then(renderActivity)` — and open the
//      `activityLanesSettled` gate from the start. 2 of 5 red, and they are the
//      two Cause A tests:
//
//        not ok 3 - THE FIRST LIST IS THE LIST
//          the spectator's first list was replaced rather than added to — it was
//          drawn to be thrown away. first [14 mark rows] final [S70 blessed, the
//          store's walk, 12 mark rows]
//        not ok 4 - A SIGNED-IN READER'S FIRST LIST ALREADY CARRIES EVERY LANE
//          the first list a signed-in reader saw came from one lane — ["mark"]
//
//      "THE PANE STAYS SHUT" stays GREEN under flip 2 and that is not a gap in
//      it: with the gate open the first render IS the first non-empty one, so
//      nothing precedes it. That test guards a flicker-then-empty, which is a
//      different failure; tests 3 and 4 are what catch the swap.
