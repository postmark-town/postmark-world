// rehearsal-posture.test.mjs — the crossing rehearsal's two guards, and the
// proof that each of them can fail.
//
// A guard that has never been seen to red is a guard nobody has measured. Every
// check in `rehearsal-posture.mjs` and every refusal in `rehearsal-stakes.mjs`
// gets a fixture here that breaks exactly that one condition, so the day one of
// them stops firing the suite says so instead of the world finding out at a
// crossing.
//
// The `[pin] ` titles read this repository's real files as text and assert over
// their shape, so they belong to the pull-request suite rather than the candle
// (suite.yml, ruled 2026-09-14). The fixture tests below are ordinary behaviour
// and run everywhere.
