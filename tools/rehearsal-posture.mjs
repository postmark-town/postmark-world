// rehearsal-posture.mjs — THE REHEARSAL CANNOT WRITE, READ OFF THE FILE THAT
// CONFIGURES IT.
//
//   node tools/rehearsal-posture.mjs [--workflow <path>] [--env] [--json]
//
// The crossing rehearsal runs a settlement over a pull request's own tree. Every
// claim in `crossing-rehearsal.yml`'s SECURITY paragraph is a sentence in a
// comment, and a sentence in a comment is worth nothing — three copies of a
// promise are one promise, copied. So the promise is READ OFF THE FILE.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, BECAUSE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS HEADER
// OVERCLAIMED IT. This is NOT a boundary against a hostile pull request. It
// cannot be: this tool is itself a file in the tree under test, so a pull request
// that wanted to weaken the workflow would weaken this beside it, and the run
// would go green. The actual boundary against an outside author is GitHub's own:
// a `pull_request` run from a fork gets a read-only token and no secrets no
// matter what the workflow file declares. That is enforcement we do not write
// and cannot lose.
//
// WHAT THIS IS: a regression guard on OURSELVES. The way this job realistically
// becomes dangerous is not an attacker — it is a maintainer, months from now,
// adding a step that needs "just a token", or switching the trigger to reach a
// base secret, or handing the sweep an env key because something broke at 05:45Z.
// Every one of those is a same-repo change by somebody with write access, and
// every one of them reds this. It runs as the job's FIRST step so it fails before
// the sweep spends four minutes, and again in the suite as a pin so it holds even
// on a pull request that never triggers the job.
//
// SEVEN CHECKS, all over the one file that decides what the job can do, plus
// the two files that decide what the job's tools consume:
//
//   1. trigger      — `pull_request`, and the string `pull_request_target`
//                     appears nowhere. `pull_request_target` runs with the BASE
//                     repository's token and secrets while checking out the
//                     pull request's code, which is the one combination that
//                     would turn this job into a write pen for anybody who can
//                     open a pull request.
//   2. permissions  — a top-level `permissions:` block granting exactly
//                     `contents: read`. Absent, it inherits whatever the
//                     repository's default is, and a repository default is not
//                     a promise this file makes.
//   3. secrets      — no `secrets.` reference. There is nothing here to unlock.
//   4. verbs        — no `git push`, `git tag`, `git remote add|set-url`, and no
//                     `gh` invocation. The sweep's own header says it never
//                     pushes; this holds the JOB to the same, so a future step
//                     cannot quietly do what the tool declines to.
//   5. env          — no `env:` block anywhere in the file. The job hands its
//                     tools nothing, which is the only claim about env that is
//                     cheap to keep true.
//   6. consumers    — the env keys `settlement-sweep.mjs` and `harm-gate.mjs`
//                     actually read are a subset of a NAMED list. This is the
//                     half check 5 cannot do alone: "the job sets nothing" is
//                     only a security property if nothing it runs reads
//                     something the runner already carries. Measured at write
//                     time: the sweep reads BOT_NAME and BOT_EMAIL (git identity
//                     fallbacks, harmless), the gate reads nothing. A new read
//                     appearing on either side reds this and asks a person.
//                     Since POS-363 it reads `marks-fold.mjs` too, the seam
//                     both load the marks through (its snapshot switch:
//                     WORLD_SNAPSHOT, WORLD_SNAPSHOT_ROOT), and a key a module
//                     names as its `*_ENV` constant counts as a read.
//   7. weight       — `harm-gate.mjs` reads no `weight`. THIS ONE IS NOT ABOUT
//                     SECURITY and it is here because it is about this
//                     rehearsal's honesty: the stakes are rebuilt from
//                     `WORLD/world-state.json`, which records escrow per holder
//                     exactly and the breadth bonus only per mark, so the rows
//                     carry `weight = n` and 38 marks' bonus (255 weight on
//                     world main e3cf2b37) is not reproduced. No gate check
//                     reads weight today, so the verdict is sound. The day one
//                     does, this goes red and the limit is a finding rather
//                     than a wrong answer nobody notices. See
//                     `tools/rehearsal-stakes.mjs` § WHAT IT DOES NOT REPRODUCE.
//
// `--env` adds an eighth, which only means anything inside the job: a named
// deny-list of store and write keys must be absent from the live environment.
// It is off by default because on a developer's box it would fail for reasons
// that say nothing about the job.
//
// Exit 0 is the posture held. Exit 1 is a posture broken, named.
