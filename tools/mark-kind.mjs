// mark-kind.mjs — WHAT A RECORD IS, AND HOW IT STANDS, IN EITHER FORM (LOGOS v2 part 2, W2).
//
// LOGOS/classes.md § The LOGOS ladder (ruled 2026-10-16 16:02): "`kind` is a
// flat field naming the node's own class … The `class:` field folds into
// `kind`: a class node's name is its own slug, so `kind: candy` names
// `the-town/candy`." A thing that wrote `kind: sited` + `class: thing` writes
// `kind: thing` now.
//
// Both forms are read, always: the old form is every store folded before the
// migration, every record a door wrote before its own readers moved, and every
// fixture. One home for the two questions every reader asks, so no reader
// spells either form out for itself:
//
//   instanceClassOf(m)  the class an instance names — its `class:` in the old
//                       form, its `kind:` in the new; undefined for a plain
//                       sited mark, a parcel, a predicate or a naming written
//                       with their standing word, and for class and property
//                       nodes (they ARE class space; their name is `class:`).
//   isSited(m)          it stands on the ground as a sited mark: it carries a
//                       place, and it is none of the kinds that never do. The
//                       lint holds every non-ground kind to no `at` (a
//                       predicate takes its parent's locus, a class or a
//                       property has no where, a post stands nowhere), so the
//                       place is the answer and no class tree is needed to ask.
//   isGround(m)         sited, or a parcel with its place: what can contain.
//
//   standingOf(m, idx)  how the record stands, asked of its CLASS CHAIN (G12,
//   isSitedIn(m, idx)   settled 2026-10-17: "the fold is the record"). The fold
//   isGroundIn(m, idx)  asks these, with the class index of the marks it folds
//                       (kindIndexOf), so its geometry follows the lineage even
//                       where a place and a chain disagree. isSited and isGround
//                       stay the place-proxy for readers with no class index
//                       (the viewer, the verbs over a store slice); they agree
//                       with the chain wherever the lint holds (G13).
//
// Browser-pure: the viewer and the store readers ask through it too.
