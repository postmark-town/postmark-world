// lane-wall.mjs — the authorship wall for the PR lane (WRITES.md).
//
// At the office door, identity is enforced by construction: the server derives
// `by` from your credential and you cannot express another household's name. A
// pull request can express anything — so this wall validates what the door made
// impossible. It answers ONE question: is every change in this diff the PR
// author's to make?
//
//   node tools/lane-wall.mjs --author-id 67605380 --author-login keeminlee \
//        --base <ref> --head <ref> [--repo <dir>] [--marks-dir <composed>] [--json]
//
// Checks, in order (each refusal names the fix — the gate teaches):
//   1. PATHS — every changed file is a mark record (WORLD/marks/**/mark.md) or
//      the author's own note (NOTES/<handle>.md). Nothing else rides this lane.
//   2. HANDLES — every `by:` on an added/changed mark, every NOTES filename, and
//      the author of every DELETED or CHANGED mark as it stood resolve, via WORLD/households.json (read from
//      the BASE ref — the trusted side), to the PR author's own household:
//      `gh:<author-id>` or `login:<author-login>`. A handle the registry does
//      not know is refused — the lane's identity model IS the registry (the
//      office door remains open to unregistered handles; registry refresh is
//      world-households-export on pin churn).
//   3. PLACEMENT — every added sited/parcel mark sits exactly where
//      `placementParent` derives from its geometry (the same function the door,
//      the fold, and the lint use); predicated/naming sit in their parent's
//      directory. The refusal prints the correct path.
//   4. NOTES — one file, your handle, ≤2000 characters (the world_note cap).
//
// Exit 0 with a one-line verdict (or {ok:true} with --json); exit 1 with the
// violations otherwise. Read-only. Run it locally before opening the PR and the
// gate has nothing left to say.
