//
// ── WHAT IS UNDER TEST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The cap refuses a parcel when its household ALREADY HOLDS the cap, so which
// parcel is refused is decided by the order the loop runs in. That order was
// `byId`'s insertion order, which is `loadMarks`' `readdirSync` walk — the
// filesystem's directory listing. It FAILS OPEN as well as arbitrarily: a
// post-law parcel walked before its household's pre-law ones is admitted at a
// count of zero and the pre-law ones follow ungated, which is how the Reeves
// came to hold five under a cap of three.
//
// It was unreachable while `WORLD/households.json` was 33 days stale, because a
// stale registry files a family's handles as strangers and no household is over
// the cap at all. It becomes reachable the moment the registry is refreshed —
// which is the office lane this travels with.
//
// ── THE LAW, VERBATIM (tools/marks-fold.mjs, the cap's own comment) ──────────
//
//   "The parcel-claim cap (Keemin's ruling, 2026-07-30): a HOUSEHOLD may CLAIM
//    at most 3 parcels. Forward law — holdings dated on/before the law date
//    stand as prior estate (the Reeves' four, the founder household's five),
//    they simply cannot claim more."
//
// Both halves of that sentence are about WHEN, so the order the gate reads them
// in is the order they were claimed. What this file asserts is that the verdict
// is a function of the record: shuffle the array and the SAME parcel is refused.
//
// ── AND THE SECOND CONSTRUCTION (founder, 2026-09-09) ───────────────────────
//
//   "please make sure this incident cannot happen again by construction."
//
// `refuseStaleHouseholds` is that construction: handed the crossing's own pinned
// town sha, a fold or a sweep REFUSES a registry derived from any other tree,
// and refuses an unstamped one. F10 and F11 drive it, unit and crossing.
