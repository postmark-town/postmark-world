// tier-frames.test.mjs — § the tier binding (marks-fold.mjs; SCHEMA.md
// § Containment is not authority). Founder-ruled 2026-08-11 evening:
//
//   A PARENT BINDS A CHILD ONLY IF ITS TIER RANKS AT OR ABOVE THE CHILD'S.
//
// A bound child is framed by its parent and rides when the parent moves. An
// outranking child is framed by the WORLD and nothing its parent does can move
// it. A predicate can never outrank what it predicates, and that one is refused.
//
// ── amended by THE FREEZE (the founder, 2026-08-25) ──────────────────────────
// The binding rule is untouched — a directory still FRAMES the numbers written
// inside it, which is arithmetic about a file. What went is the other half: the
// directory no longer CLAIMS containment, so a drifted edge is not a finding and
// there is no repair. "The directory-matches-containment law is REPEALED — the
// tree's paths make no assertion, so nothing about them can become false."
// Several tests below are the inverse of what they used to assert, and say so
// where they stand.
//
// ── amended by the one-walk tier truth (Keemin, 2026-08-12) ──────────────────
// The binding rule above is untouched. What changed is WHERE A RANK COMES FROM:
// the `tier:` line on a record is no longer read as authority, because standing
// is derived by the one walk (tools/mark-standing.mjs) and a resident does not
// declare it. So the ladder the frame sees has the town's constitution above,
// everything standing on resident ground at market, and draft below — and
// "green in yellow", the quadrant a resident could once reach by writing
// `tier: sovereignty` on their house, no longer exists. A house on its own
// parcel BINDS to it, which is what owning your ground means.
//
// Three quadrants, two refusals, and a falsifier. The quadrants say what the
// rule means; the falsifier says the change that introduced it moved no ground.
