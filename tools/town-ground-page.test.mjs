// town-ground-page.test.mjs — the falsifier that DRIVES THE PAGE.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT A FLATTERING REASON ────────────────
//
// `tools/town-ground.test.mjs` has ten tests and every one of them hands
// `townGround` its marks BY HAND. So when this lane's first call site passed
// `data.marks` — a property that does not exist on `data` — all ten stayed
// green while the live page drew a ground with the entire mark record missing:
// no region washes at all, and six water features silently falling back to
// their centrelines. It painted. It looked like a map from across the room.
//
// I then added a source-text assertion that reads the call site out of the
// viewer's own bytes, and thought that closed it. It does not. The fresh
// reviewer kept the call site exactly as written, DISCARDED THE ANSWER, mounted
// a blank sheet in its place — and all 754 tests stayed green. A regex over the
// source proves a line was typed, never that its value reaches the screen. It is
// also brittle in the other direction: reordering `mountScene`'s arguments reds
// it while nothing about the page has changed.
//
// The only assertion that cannot be satisfied by well-typed dead code is one
// that reads the mounted DOM. So: boot the real rig, open the real page with the
// atlas UNREACHABLE, and count what is actually on the ground.
//
// ── AND IT GUARDS A SECOND, OLDER CLASS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `.wv-ph-extent` is asserted here for a reason beyond the town's own look.
// Every existing test of the furnishing pass — `tools/map-art-default.test.mjs`,
// `tools/viewer-interior.test.mjs` — calls `placeholderExtentSVG` directly with
// a hand-built full mark. NOT ONE of them drives `drawOverlay`'s SET
// CONSTRUCTION, which is where this lane's second bug lived: the set is built
// from `overlayMarks(radial)`, whose entries carry `id`, `at`, `distM` and
// `bearing`, while `isEmbodiedMark` asks for `kind` and `extent` — so the filter
// answered no to every mark and the pass furnished nothing at all. Forty-eight
// green scene tests could not see it, because none of them ever asked the page.
//
// (A correction to the review that prompted this file, and the record should
// carry it: the pass was NOT dead in rooms. `composeInterior` resolves its
// radial through `things.map((t) => byId.get(t.id) ?? t)` and says in its own
// comment why — "investigate SHAPES its children for a reader … and drops extent
// and image on the way. A floor needs both." The TOWN's radial, from
// `openYourEyes`, has no such resolve, so the town was the only broken scene.
// The CLASS the reviewer named is real and open all the same: no test drove that
// set construction, which is why nobody could tell the two cases apart.)
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP, WHICH IS THE REVIEWER'S OWN ─────────────────────────
//
// In `loadMinimap`, keep the call and throw the answer away:
//
//     const ground = townGround(world.marks, data.skeleton, { originPx, mPerPx });

//       '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100"></svg>',
//       "image/svg+xml");                       // ← blank sheet, answer discarded
//
// Every source-text guard in this repo stays green. This file reds on the first
// assertion. Run receipt in the lane report.
