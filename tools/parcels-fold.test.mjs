//   node --test tools/parcels-fold.test.mjs
//
// Why this file exists: nothing tested assembleWorld's output shape, and the
// walk draft's home resolution read `world.parcels` off the fold — which the
// fold did not publish. Every walker silently started at the Origin instead of on
// their own ground. It hid because "no parcel → the Origin" is also LEGITIMATE
// behaviour for an unplaced resident, so total failure looked ordinary.
//
// The lesson these tests encode: when a fallback is indistinguishable from
// success, the contract that feeds it needs a test that can fail loudly.
