//
//   · "CONTAINED OR LISTED: every mark under a region is one or the other" —
//     a weaker duplicate. The same biconditional is held by
//     tools/region-outsiders.test.mjs § "CONTAINED OR LISTED holds against the
//     freshly folded list", which folds a scratch copy and checks the property
//     against the fold's own output, over REGION_SLUGS' thirteen regions where
//     this file's RINGED is twelve. That one is non-vacuous — a mis-wire in
//     marks-fold.mjs reds it — and it is the form that survives.
//
//   · "DECOUPLED: a listed mark stands outside its ring AND is still filed

//     perturbations, one per listed mark, each moved inside its own region's
//     ring — it fired zero times. The law it named is real and is enforced by
//     construction in the deriver, which is why there is nothing left to assert.

// re-shape broke ground and filing apart on purpose, so a resident left outside
// keeps their filing while their ground stands where they put it.
//
// But the test could only ever go red against a STALE list. Both halves are
// construction guarantees of deriveOutsiders — the ground half because a row is
// pushed only when !rectInsideRing(ring, rectOf(k)), the filing half because
// rows are built only from descendantsOf(region.id) — so any correctly derived
// list satisfies it by definition, and the committed file satisfies it too for
// every interval in which it is current. Measured before deleting: 33
// perturbations, one per listed mark, each moved inside its own region's ring,
// and it fired zero times.
//
// The law is enforced where it is made, in tools/region-outsiders.mjs §
// deriveOutsiders, not asserted here against a file whose disagreement is only
// ever a clock. Removing it is what ends this file's share of the red interval.
