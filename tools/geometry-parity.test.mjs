// geometry-parity.test.mjs — coords-equivalence, extended into CROSSING-SPACE.
//
// tools/coords-equivalence.mjs proves the v2→v3 migration preserved every mark's
// POSITION. This proves the thing built on top of positions: that the CHAIN a
// crossing derives is the same one, and that it is only the same when the
// derivation stands on the STORE.
//
// Founder-found 2026-08-20: clicking enter on rei/the-lanternstep-house did
// nothing — the door answered success with entered: [], no terms, no refusal, no
// ledger row. And entering a 2×2 bench in the town centre wrote crossings
// through a house 1.3 km away.
//
// ── THE LAW, and there is only ONE transform ────────────────────────────────
//
// SCHEMA v3 § The frame, and marks-fold.mjs states it in its own words: a BOUND
// child (parent tier rank ≥ child rank) is framed by its parent — its `at:` is
// an offset from that parent's CENTRE. An OUTRANKING child is framed by the
// world; its numbers never mentioned its parent. Composition happens once, at
// load, in exactly one function, and "everything downstream reads `at` in world
// coordinates and cannot tell which frame the files were written in".
//
// RECORDS ARE OFFSETS. THE STORE IS ABSOLUTE. Verified by arithmetic against the
// live tree — each line is record + parent-centre = store, exactly:
//
//   rei/the-lanternseed-gardens        {1325,-1000} + {0,0}        = {1325,-1000}
//   rei/…-house-parcel                 {-250,200}   + {1325,-1000} = {1075,-800}
//   rei/the-lanternstep-house          {0,0}        + {1075,-800}  = {1075,-800}
//   wright/the-crossing-bench          {87,83}      + {-75,-75}    = {12,8}
//
// (An earlier version of this file claimed a SECOND "legacy-grid reprojection".
// There is none — the parcel's derived_from grid_m is seeding provenance quoting
// the world position, not another frame. The model is pure rank-based parent
// composition. Corrected before it could become doctrine by repetition.)
//
// So the fault has exactly one shape and one fix: a consumer that parses mark
// records itself holds OFFSETS and treats them as positions. The fix is never to
// reimplement the composition — it is to CONSUME the store.
