// record-sources.mjs — WHERE A READER MAY READ THE TOWN'S RECORD FROM.
//
// One place decides the source chain for every public record file the viewer
// reads, because the thing that went wrong was decided in five different places
// and nobody could see all five at once.
//
// ── THE LAW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The site's world pin obeys a guardrail the founder ruled on 2026-08-25, and
// it is quoted here verbatim rather than paraphrased:
//
//     "tags only, never main tip."
//
// That guardrail is enforced at BUILD time by `tools/lib/world-pin.mjs` in the
// site repo: prod is assembled from a blessed `settlement/S<n>` tag and never
// from this repo's main branch. But a build-time guardrail is only as strong as
// what the page does at READ time — and until 2026-08-26 the viewer answered
// every record it could not find same-origin by fetching
// `raw.githubusercontent.com/postmark-town/postmark-world/main`, which is the world's
// main tip: precisely the bytes the guardrail exists to keep out of prod.
//
// It was not hypothetical. `WORLD/walk-ledger.md` was missing from the site's
// staging list, so `https://postmark.town/WORLD/walk-ledger.md` answered 404 in
// production, and every departure the town displayed was read from unblessed
// main. The build obeyed the law and the page walked around it.
//
// So the second half of the guardrail lives here: **no chain this module builds
// may name the world's main tip.** A record that cannot be read from the page's
// own origin (or from an office standing beside it) is an ABSENCE, and an
// absence is something a reader is told about — never something quietly filled
// in from a branch nobody blessed.
//
// ── WHAT REPLACED THE FALLBACK ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The raw fallback was never really serving the standalone habitat it was
// written for; it was covering two missing routes. `spectator/server.mjs` now
// serves `/WORLD/walk-ledger.md` off this clone's own disk, exactly as it
// already served world-state and the threshold ledger, so a local spectator
// reads a complete record from the tree it is standing in — which is strictly
// better than github's main branch ever was. (It served the seeding manifest
// here too, until that file was deleted — postmark#3025.)
//
// Pure and I/O-free on purpose: these are decisions, and a decision that cannot
// be tested without a network is a decision nobody tests.
