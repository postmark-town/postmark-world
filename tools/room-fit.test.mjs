// room-fit.test.mjs — THE FLOOR OF THE WHEEL IS THE WHOLE ROOM, CONTAINED.
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-15 (Linear POS-95 / postmark#2849): "zoom out is also *too*
// heavily constrained in interiors. often you can't even zoom out enough to see
// the whole mark's interior. we should double check the zoom cap logic and also
// just add some padding to it so it's not claustrophobic."
//
// ── the mechanism, measured before it was changed ───────────────────────────
//
// A room mounts with `zoomOutLimit: 1`, and the wheel read that as a multiple
// of `full` — the ground svg's own viewBox:
//
//     const w = Math.min(… : full.w * zoomOutLimit, …)
//
// `refit` meanwhile showed the room WHOLE at rest, letterboxed into the pane.
// Those two are not the same rectangle. In a pane WIDER than the room's ground
// the resting view is `full.h * paneAspect` across — wider than `full.w` — so
// the wheel's floor sat INSIDE the resting view. The first notch of zoom-OUT
// therefore zoomed IN, cropping the room's left and right edges (and the pad,
// which is drawn inside the svg and is cropped with it), and the cap forbade
// widening back out. Only ⌂ fit, which routes through `refit`, could undo it.
//
// A 25 × 25 parcel in a 1600 × 900 pane: the resting view is 1706.7 ground-px
// across and the wheel's floor was 960 — the room lost 44 % of its horizontal
// span the moment the reader touched the wheel, with no way back.
//
// ── the fix ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `containFit` is that one question — how wide is the whole ground in THIS pane
// — with one owner. `refit` asks it (it had the arithmetic inline and correct)
// and so does the wheel's floor, times ROOM_ZOOM_OUT_SLACK so the wall is never
// pressed against the pane's edge. `roomGround`'s pad rises 0.12 → 0.25, which
// is the other half of "not claustrophobic": the slack is camera air, the pad
// is drawn floor, and neither substitutes for the other.
//
// The room stays the outermost STATE. Nothing here reaches the town.
//
// ── on this harness, and on its own first failure ───────────────────────────
// The wheel handler lives inside mountViewer's closure and needs a DOM, so what
// is exercised here is the arithmetic it now delegates to — the same call, the
// same numbers — plus [pin]s that BOTH readers really delegate. The suite has
// no runtime dependencies by construction (CI installs only playwright, a
// devDependency, since POS-372), so there is no jsdom to mount the real closure
// in; the browser pass is the rig's.
//
// ⚑ THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS FILE PASSED ITS OWN FLIP. Its central assertion
// compared the wheel's floor to the resting view and took BOTH from
// `containFit`, so with that function gutted to `return full` it reduced to
// `1.25 * x >= x` and stayed green. Everything below therefore reasons in
// closed forms — `restWidth`, `widthNeededFor`, `oldFloorWidth` — and exactly
// one test ties the implementation to them. The defect is asserted directly,
// as the two numbers the founder met, rather than as a relation between two
// readings of the same function.
