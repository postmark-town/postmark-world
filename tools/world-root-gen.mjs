// RULINGS THIS OBEYS:
// - The root mark is `let-there-be-light`: by: the-town, tier: constitution,
//   extent = the whole world, body = the charter establishing line.
// - Terrain features become marks UNDER it (river, seas, lochan, garrison lake,
//   locks, coasts, upward falls, Pando, ferry's route), by: the-town, tier:
//   constitution. Two-precision geometry: the mark carries a COARSE bounding
//   rect as the CLAIM and a `feature: <skeleton-feature-id>` link; skeleton.json
//   remains beneath as the precise survey (followable through that link).
// - `by: the-town` is the town-tier author (flagged reviewable — Wright's call)
//   for the features the town still holds. A feature whose MARK has passed to a
//   household is SPOKEN FOR and is not regenerated — see the transferred-ground
//   gate below (founder-ruled 2026-09-10).
// - Pando is a horizon object, not heightfield ground (decision 008): its mark
//   carries `far: true`, and the containment check exempts it (it sits beyond
//   the world's ground extent by construction).

// mark's offset as a world position, and (2) plant relocated terrain at world
// numbers inside a parent's frame. Both would print success. So it stops here
// instead, and says what it would take to let it run.
//
// `--law` IS FRAME-SAFE, and is the one run allowed past this gate (POS-223,
// 2026-10-01). It writes only the root's four law predicates, and a predicate
// carries no `at:` and no `extent:` — no number in any frame — so neither

// DEC-16 transfer act: the SURVEY beneath it stays the town's — the skeleton
// entry, its geometry, its kind, everything this file extracts from — but the
// CLAIM over that ground is now a household's record, and this generator has no
// business rewriting it.
//
// WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT THIS GATE, measured on the first three (merrick's
// footbridge, stone path and grove, 2026-09-10). indexExistingDirs() above
// indexes ONLY `by: the-town` records, so a transferred mark drops out of it and
// writeMarkRaw() falls back to `relDir` — the bare feature id at the root:
//
//   a mark ALREADY at the root (the grove, the stone path) is silently
//   OVERWRITTEN, the household's record replaced by a town-authored one;
//   a NESTED mark (the footbridge, under the inlet) gets a TWIN planted at the
//   root while the household's copy stays where it is.
//
// Both print success. Neither is visible until someone reads the tree.
//
// KEYED ON THE `feature:` LINK, not on the slug. The link is the join between
// the coarse claim and the precise survey (SCHEMA § the two-precision link), it
// survives a transfer by that section's own ruling, and it is how the other
// generator finds a record too (water-shapes-gen's recordPathFor). A slug key
// could not do this job: `finn/the-still-reach` shares a leaf with the town's
// own reach and would falsely gate it, which is the very confusion the index
// above keeps its author check to avoid.
//
// The walk is over ALL of WORLD/marks, not just the root: a fossil transfer
// leaves the directory in place (the freeze), but a post-freeze terrain mark
// would file at WORLD/marks/<household>/<slug>, outside MARKS_ROOT entirely.
//
// THE FIELD IS READ FROM THE FRONTMATTER, NOT FOUND IN THE FILE (hardened
// 2026-09-10, on review). A `/^feature:.../m` scan over the whole text also
// matches a line in a BODY, and this gate turns that into a refusal to write:
// a passer-by's ordinary mark whose prose happens to contain a line reading
// `feature: blackwater-bend-grove` would make the generator decline to write
// the town's own grove and say the grove was spoken for. So the record is
// parsed and the field is read where the schema puts it. (The same looseness
// still sits in water-shapes-gen's recordPathFor, which this gate is otherwise
// modelled on; it is noted rather than fixed here, being that tool's own.)
//
// AND A FEATURE IS CLAIMED ONCE. recordPathFor refuses on `hits.length !== 1`
// for exactly this reason: two records claiming one survey entry is an
// ambiguous world, and a silent last-wins would pick a winner by directory
// order. Two claims on one feature is the twin condition this gate exists to
// prevent, so meeting one already planted is a refusal, not a shrug.
