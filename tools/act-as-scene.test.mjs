// act-as-scene.test.mjs — THE SCENE FOLLOWS THE ACTOR, ON EVERY ARM OF THE SWITCH.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE CHANGES NO BEHAVIOUR (POS-94 / postmark#2848) ─────────────
//
// The issue reports that switching act-as leaves the previous resident's
// interior mounted, and that a Spectator inherits a room it can never leave. It
// proposes three fixes, the first being "every act-as switch, warm or cold, ends
// in syncScene for the new key".
//
// That fix is already here, and was here before the report. It landed 2026-08-19
// (2505170a, "a warm switch cannot leave you in somebody else's room") after the
// same symptom was met with kilean, and `activateTellingPane` carries both the
// call and the note. It is on the build the founder was reading: the viewer
// served at postmark.town/world-engine/spectator/viewer.mjs on 2026-09-16 is
// world fc5a2c4d byte-for-byte (md5 f75b6d112c349ec55175f1a055c40d57), and it
// contains `syncScene(key)` ahead of the early return.
//
// Driven on the real page against this clone's own record — keith is inside
// keith/the-garage at the ledger's end, jetto-of-starforge's passage stack is
// empty — the switch behaves correctly in four conditions: the fold arm, the
// resident path, a boot straight into a room with no town ever mounted, and
// straight from inside to Spectator. In every one the room comes down, the town
// mounts, and the exit pill goes.
//
// So the diagnosis is returned rather than implemented, and what is left behind
// is this: the behaviour the issue asks for, pinned, so it cannot be dropped
// again. Dropping `syncScene(key)` from `activateTellingPane` was measured to
// break the switch BACK into a room on the warm path — the call is load-bearing
// today, not vestigial.
//
// Proposal 3 in the issue ("the way-out pill is never shown to a spectator on a
// room it cannot leave") guards a state this code cannot reach, and the last
// test says why in the one place it is checkable: a spectator is handed an empty
// passage stack by construction, so no interior is ever filed under the
// spectator key, so `syncScene` can never mount a room for it. A guard against
// an impossible state teaches the next reader to fear the wrong thing; the
// falsifier is written instead.
