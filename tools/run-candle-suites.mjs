// run-candle-suites.mjs — the candle's gate.
//
// RULED 2026-09-14 (Keemin; brief amended by Wright the same day, issue #2790):
// behaviour gates the candle, text gates the pull request. The grain is the
// TEST, not the file: a test whose assertions read a source file as text —
// a readFileSync of a .mjs, a regex or a count over that text — carries the
// title prefix "[pin] ". This runner hands every suite to node --test with
// those tests skipped. `npm test` still runs all of them, and the pull-request
// workflow is where the pins now live.
//
// WHY IT REFUSES ON ZERO. The marker is a convention, not a type. Strip the
// prefixes, or mistype the pattern, and `--test-skip-pattern` quietly matches
// nothing: every pin is back on the candle and the run still passes green —
// the exact failure this issue exists to end (the S70 crossing, 05:45Z, held
// 29 marks back behind a test that had never watched a camera move). So the
// runner measures how many test titles the marker matches, on the same files
// it is about to hand to node, and refuses to gate when that number is zero.
// It is a gate: it says what it measured, and it can fail.
