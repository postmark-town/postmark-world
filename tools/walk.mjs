// ── where within the target's ground a walk ends ────────────────────────────
//
// Two arrivals, one grammar (issue #5 §1, jetto-of-starforge). ENTRY is the
// default and stays it: the walk ends at the first point on the target's ground,
// because walking "to" a 3.6 km mountain has no business teleporting you to its
// middle. CENTRE is for when the intent is to arrive AT a place rather than
// merely reach it — and it is what lets a resident who landed on a fence walk
// IN, which is the whole cost of the seam: arrival-on-entry leaves you standing
// exactly on the boundary, where any rect you then claim straddles the line and
// nests one level out.
//
// CENTRE NEEDS NO NEW LEDGER TOKEN. `within` is precisely what makes arrival
// mean "the derived point entered the target's extent"; a departure that records
// no `within` interpolates all the way to `toward`, which IS the mark's centre.
// So the variant is expressed in the grammar that already exists — and it is not
// even a new idiom: the vessel has always sailed this way (vessel.mjs records
// `targetExtent: null` with a `targetMarkId` so she lies exactly on her stop).
//
// Nothing is lost by the omission. `to <mark-id>` still records what was asked
// for, so the line says where the walker was headed either way; and the freeze
// that `within` performs for an entry walk has nothing to freeze for a centre
// one, because `toward` is already the frozen point the walk ends at. A later
// move or resize of the target cannot rewrite either arrival.
// RENAMED 2026-08-19 (founder-ruled, the Seven zero-distance confusion): the
// field is `mode:`, the words are `rim` and `center`. "to:" invited mark names
// into an enum slot, and "centre" collided with the Town Centre's own name.
// The legacy pair stays VALID here deliberately — the office imports this file
// from the world clone at runtime, so an older office deploy passing "entry"
// against a newer clone must keep working; the office normalizes legacy → canon
// before anything is recorded or spoken.

// ── THE RING WINS HERE TOO (founder-ruled 2026-09-11: "ring wins everywhere") ─
//
// A mark's shape is its `points:` ring when it has one and its at/extent box
// otherwise, and every tool that asks WHERE something is or whether a point is
// INSIDE it asks that one shape. `pointWithinMark`, `marksContain` and
// `containmentChain` have preferred the ring since the regions took their true
// shape. The WALK did not, and the gap was not theoretical: wright walked to
// wright/the-trueing-terrace (a 12-point ring inset from its 1834 x 1563 box),
// the rim arrival stopped him at y = -1669 — the box's near edge — and by the
// ring that point stands in rei/the-lanternseed-gardens. The walk desk put him
// on his neighbour's ground and called it arrival.
//
// WHY THE FIX IS A FROZEN POINT AND NOT A RING ON THE LINE. Position is a pure
// function of (record, clock): `positionAt` is handed a parsed ledger line and
// nothing else, and the line's `within <w>,<h>` is a BOX by grammar. Putting a
// twelve-vertex ring on every departure line would be a new field in an
// append-only public record, and re-resolving the mark id at derivation time
// would let a later re-cut of a ring rewrite where somebody already arrived —
// the exact thing `within` was introduced to prevent. So the ring is consulted
// ONCE, at declaration, and what it decides is frozen as the departure's own
// `toward` with no extent beside it.
//
// THIS IS NOT A NEW IDIOM. `src/arena.mjs § arrivalOnGround` already writes a
// mark-targeted departure exactly this way, and its own note carries the
// argument verbatim: "a named point is MORE frozen than a rect, not less (a
// later resize of the room cannot rewrite an arrival that is a coordinate), and
// the target's id still rides the ledger line, so the record says where the
// walker was headed either way." A ring is a re-cut waiting to happen, which
// makes the case here stronger, not weaker.
//
// Nothing downstream changes shape. `targetEntryT`, `positionAt`'s arrival
// predicate, the viewer's leg-clipping and the arena's own entry maths all read
// a rect off the line; a ringed target now puts no rect there, so all four
// simply take the no-extent path they already take for a `center` walk and for
// every vessel sailing. One arrival truth, still — and no second shape function:
// the ring comes from `polygonOf`, the membership test from `pointInPolygon`,
// both the ones geometry.mjs already owns.

// How far past the boundary an arrival stands. ON the ring is not IN it — the
// ray-cast at a vertex is a coin toss and a rect claimed from the line straddles
// it — which is the same seam the `center` mode was invented for, one metre
// wide. A dial, movable by ruling, never silently.
