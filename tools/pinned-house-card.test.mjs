// pinned-house-card.test.mjs — the house you are reading stays the house you
// are reading (Keemin, 2026-09-12: "when a house is clicked (and the column is
// up), it gets pinned in its 'zoomed' form even when zoomed out").
//
//   node --test tools/pinned-house-card.test.mjs
//
// THE POINT. Zooming out to see where a house sits should not take the thing
// you are reading and turn it back into a bead. While a column is open, that
// ONE parcel answers `near` at every tier — picture, name, frame — and every
// other house on the map follows the camera exactly as before.
//
// TWO HALVES, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE THAT NEARLY GOT MISSED. The rule itself
// is one line in homeCard. But a selection does not redraw the overlay: the six
// drawOverlay call sites are the first radial, the camera settle, the pane
// refit, the layout settle, the dev dials and the resident record read, and not
// one of them is a click. markInteraction.subscribe runs
// syncMarkInteractionViews, which toggles classes, moves the highlight, syncs
// the chip and renders the bubbles, and touches the overlay's markup not at
// all. So without a trigger the pin would have been correct code that never
// ran until the reader moved the camera — the one thing they were not doing.
// Measured before building; the trigger is asserted here as its own falsifier.
//
// The page is driven, for the reason tools/town-ground-page.test.mjs gives at
// length. Playwright absent SKIPS LOUDLY and names what went unguarded.
