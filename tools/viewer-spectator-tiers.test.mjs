// viewer-spectator-tiers.test.mjs — the spectator's three distances, the pixel
// rule, the cull box and the far crowd, each asked of the pure function that
// decides it.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// It can prove that `tierFor` returns the right word, that the word moves when
// a dial moves, and that the markup builders emit what they claim. It CANNOT
// prove that any of it reached the drawing — which is exactly the false green
// `tools/town-ground-page.test.mjs` was written after: forty-eight scene tests
// stayed green while the furnishing pass drew nothing at all, because every one
// of them called the builder directly and none of them asked the page.
//
// So the gates have a page-driven twin over there ("THE FAR TIER DRAWS NO
// FURNITURE", "THE CULL IS A CULL"), and this file is the vocabulary underneath
// it. Neither is sufficient alone and the pair is named in both directions on
// purpose.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIPS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each block names the edit that reds it. They were run, and their output is in
// docs/2026-09-11/jetto-spectator-10x-report.md rather than described here.
