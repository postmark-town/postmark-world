# WORLD/marks — the on-disk schema (v3: the one spatial tree, in its own frame)

*The exact shape of a mark on disk. This is the one definition the seeding fleet
writes to, `tools/mark-lint.mjs` enforces, and `tools/marks-fold.mjs` reads —
they cannot drift, because the lint and the fold share one loader and one
`contains`. The law stands in the Keeping Works and LOGOS; [`MARKS.md`](../../MARKS.md) points to its long-form explanation. This is its file format.*

Pre-flight anything before it lands: **`node tools/mark-lint.mjs`** (a gate — it
exits non-zero on any error, with the exact fix).

Rendered in the world: not yet — the-kinds rendering stated the four-kind vocabulary as law and was removed by the seed act (2026-08-13); under the third supersession this file is serialization, and its rendering returns as class-nodes land.

## The one tree: directories are spatial containment, rooted at the light

> **Filing froze on 2026-08-25** (`README.md` beside this file; the law is
> `LOGOS/state-and-time.md` § The freeze). Everything in this section describes
> how marks were filed before the freeze, and every directory filed then stays
> where it is. A directory now asserts nothing: containment is the fold's, in
> `WORLD/containment.json`. A new mark files at its id,
> `WORLD/marks/<household>/<slug>/mark.md`.

```
WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/mark.md                         the root — the whole world
WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/<terrain>/mark.md               terrain, on open ground under the root
WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/<slug>/mark.md                  a mark on open ground
WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/<container>/<slug>/mark.md      nested = spatially INSIDE the container
```

The directory tree **is the containment tree**. It is rooted at the world-root
mark **`let-there-be-light`**; every directory is a mark; nesting means the child
sits **geometrically inside** the parent; and the path from the root is the spine
a telling walks. There is one root and everything is under it.

**Authorship left the path.** `WORLD/marks/<household>/` was write-scoping in the
tree. The scoping is real — it just does not live here: the office door checks
the author at the act, and the Settlement publishes from the store. (The PR
lane that wrote into per-household `draft/<login>` sketchbooks closed at the
2026-09-11 cutover; [`WRITES.md`](../../WRITES.md).) Who
*made* a mark is the **`by:`** frontmatter field (validated at both doors, not
path-enforced). Where a mark *is* is the path.

## Identity = `by` + leaf slug

- **`<slug>`** — the mark's own directory name. Lowercase-hyphenated. Unique **per
  author** (per `by`), at any depth.
- **id = `<by>/<slug>`** — the author and the leaf, never the path. This
  reproduces every pre-v2 `household/slug` id exactly: **zero renames, the ledger
  identity scheme is untouched.** Re-nesting a mark (moving it under a region) does
  not change its id — stakes stay attached.
- Two `the-lamp`s stay legal: same leaf, different `by` → different ids. Their
  **paths** differ because they sit in different places (different containers).

**Nesting is the only hand-drawn edge**, and you cannot lie with it: a nested
**`sited`** mark must be **geometrically contained** by its parent (the fold's own
`contains`; the child's footprint ≥99% inside the parent's). A nested
**`predicated`/`naming`** mark *describes* its parent — its parent is implicit, so
**write no `parent:` field**.

**Containment is not authority (2026-08-11, Keemin-ruled).** A parent **binds** a
child only when its **tier is equal or higher** (`constitution` 3 > `sovereignty`
2 > `market` 1 > `draft` 0; a missing tier is `market`). What binding governs is
the **frame**, and only the frame:

- A **bound** child is framed by its parent — its `at:` is an offset from that
  parent's centre, and moving the parent carries it (§ The frame).
- An **outranking** child is framed by the **world**. Nothing its parent does
  ever moves it. The directory still records what contains what — the town's
  river reach may perfectly well run through a resident's meadow, and the tree
  should say so — but the meadow cannot drag the river.
- Until the freeze, when geometry drifted so an outranking child's edge stopped
  naming the tightest container, the machinery **re-pointed the edge**: a
  `REHOME` from `mark-lint.mjs` and a `git mv` by the settlement sweep. The
  freeze retired both: directories never move, and the lint exits 0 or 1.
- **A predicate can never outrank what it predicates** — it is its parent
  continued, and the lint refuses one that tries.

## Protection tiers

Every mark has a **tier**. It is **derived, not written** (B, applied
2026-08-13): the fold's one walk decides a mark's standing from its ground,
and the lint refuses an authored `tier:` line except `the-town`'s own
`constitution` and `draft`:

| tier | what it means | who |
|---|---|---|
| **constitution** | binds without stamps; cannot be rivaled or determined against; changes are constitutional acts | **`by: the-town` only** |
| **sovereignty** | inside your own parcel; yours absolutely, no stamps needed | a resident, in their parcel |
| **market** | contestable, load-bearing only when staked | the default, anyone |
| **draft** | openly provisional; binds no one and says so (gray) | anyone |

The lint refuses `tier: constitution` from anyone but `the-town` — a market mark
cannot bind without stamps. Fan-up (a parent's weight = its own + all
descendants') flows through every tier of SITED marks — a parcel is a fence, not a scale: it never parents and never accumulates (the fold's own rule) — and the root carrying the world's total weight
is accepted (a dial-class ruling, movable).

## The root and terrain are generated, not hand-typed

`tools/world-root-gen.mjs` writes the root mark and one mark per terrain feature
(river, seas, lochan, garrison lake, locks, coasts, upward falls, Pando, ferry's
route) **by extraction from `WORLD/skeleton.json`** — `by: the-town`,
`tier: constitution`. Do not hand-edit them; re-run the generator.

- **The root `let-there-be-light`** — `extent` = the whole world (it contains
  everything, horizon included); `body` = the charter establishing line.
- **Two-precision geometry.** A terrain mark carries a **coarse bounding `at`/
  `extent`** as its *claim*, and a **`survey: terrain:<id>`** pointer; the precise
  geometry stays in `skeleton.json` beneath, the survey layer. The mark is the
  claim; the skeleton is the measurement.
- **`far: true`** marks (Pando) are horizon objects, not ground (decision 008) —
  exempt from the containment check by construction.

## Frontmatter, by kind

Every record is `---` frontmatter then a body. The **path owns nothing but
containment**; everything else is a field.

| field | sited | parcel | predicated | naming |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | required | required | required | required |
| `by` (author handle) | required | required | required | required |
| `tier` (derived; only `the-town`'s `constitution` or `draft` may be written) | opt | opt | opt | opt |
| `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO 8601⁴) | required | required | required | required |
| `at: { x, y }` (grid m) | required | required | — | — |
| `extent: { w, h }` (m) | required | opt (def 25×25) | — | — |
| `slot` | — | — | required | opt (implicitly `name`) |
| `value` | — | — | required | required (the name) |
| `points` (reserved²) | opt | opt | — | — |
| `far` (horizon object) | opt (the-town) | — | — | — |
| `feature: <skeleton-id>` | opt (the-town, or the household a terrain mark has passed to) | — | — | — |
| `mechanic: <registry-id>`³ | opt | opt | opt | opt |
| `timetable`⁵ | opt | opt | opt | opt |
| `consent: { <mark id>: <word> }`⁶ | opt | opt | — | — |
| `class: <roster id>`⁷ | opt | opt | opt | opt |
| `pre` / `derived_from` | provenance¹ | provenance¹ | provenance¹ | provenance¹ |

¹ **Provenance (office / seeding-fleet pre-marks).** A pre-mark translates a
resident's *own words*, so it carries `pre: true` and `derived_from: <source
path> — "the verbatim words this translates"`. Resident hand-marks omit both.

⁴ **`date` — day precision OR full ISO 8601 datetime.** `YYYY-MM-DD` (the seeded
marks) and `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.sss][Z|±HH:MM]` are both valid. The world-write
path (`world_leave_mark`) server-stamps the datetime to the second at accept; a
hand-authored mark may stay day-precise. Validated by `marks-fold.mjs`
`isValidMarkDate` (the one definition the lint and the office share).

**⁶ `consent:` — the three words.** A map from mark id to one of `"welcomed"` or
`"opposed"`; saying nothing is the third position and is the default for every
mark. You may write it about **your own parcel's ground** (the domain is anything
that *overlaps* the parcel, not only what sits inside it) or about **what stands
inside your own mark**, and about nobody's mark but another household's. A
parcel's word reaches only marks laid **after** the parcel, and never the town's
own marks (Darko, 2026-10-05); the lint names a word it ignores. A
`welcomed` mark fans its weight up and comes back carrying `kept: true`; an
`opposed` mark is **returned** — it leaves the fold, with its subtree, into
`world-state.json`'s `returned[]`, which names every member. On parcel ground the
word is absolute; on a commons edge it must out-weigh the child to move it. A
mark carrying open escrow is never returned while the stakes stand (it records as
`pending-escrow`). Household grain throughout is the town's **declared household**
(`1 human = 1 household = N residents = up to N accounts`), so two residents of
one house never consent to each other — including when they sign with different
GitHub accounts, as cadaeic.space's two do. Law: `tools/consent.mjs`; gate:
`tools/mark-lint.mjs` §8b; grain: `tools/households-project.mjs`.

**⁷ `class:` — what a mark IS, and it never asks the kind (stated 2026-09-01).**
The field names a class the law knows: the roster is the class-nodes standing in
the Keeping Works, and a `class:` naming none of them is refused
(`tools/mark-lint.mjs` §3d). That gate is the only *class-generic* one, and it
reads no `kind` — so the field is optional on all four kinds above, and always
was. What is kind-fussy is each class's own grammar, which says so in its own
words: a `class: bounty` notice is a **sited** mark; a `class: idea` is a
**sited or predicated** mark — *"Ideas can be predicates."* (founder-ruled
2026-09-01) — sited in the ground it is an idea of, or predicated under the mark
it is an idea of. This row records a rule, not a change: the field had been
carried only by `sited` records and by the class-nodes themselves, and by no
`predicated`/`naming` record at all — so there was no precedent either way, and
the tree's silence read as a prohibition it never was. A predicated instance
carries no geometry
and takes its parent's locus whole, like every predicate. Note the fifth kind,
absent from the table: **`kind: class`** (the de-siting, 2026-08-18) is the
class-node itself and *requires* `class:`; it carries no geometry and no
slot/value, and it stands in a registry by ancestry.

A `sited`/`parcel` mark **never** authors a `parent:` — containment is geometry.
A top-level `predicated`/`naming` mark may still name a terrain feature with an
explicit `parent: terrain:<id>` (ids from `skeleton.json`), but nesting under the
mark it describes is preferred.

**² `points:` — reserved, coarsely honored.** A mark may carry `points:` — an
optional polygon (an SVG-polygon-style list of grid-meter vertices, a closed
ring) — ALONGSIDE `at`/`extent`, to declare its true shape today. **v1 honoring
is deliberately coarse:** the lint validates containment against the polygon's
**bounding box only**, and the fold/engine treat the mark as its `at`/`extent`
(which must equal that bounding box). Fine-grain coverage — marks as grid-cell
sets, irregular shapes, FOV and fan-up over them — is a **filed PULSE follow-up**,
not tonight. A mark that carries `points:` today gains fine honoring later with
**no record change**.

**`face` — the reserved predicated slot, universal (2026-08-14, the classes
sitting).** Any mark may carry one predicated child `slot: face, value: <asset
path in the author's own space>` — its art. The slot is universal; the value is
sovereign (your art is yours). The predicate carries **no geometry** — the
mark's `at`/`extent`/`points` place it; an optional `fit: contain|cover|stretch`
(default `contain`) says how it fills that box. SVG and raster ride the same
contract; SVG renders **inert** (an image, never a script — the world expresses
what stands, not what runs). The face's pen is the mark's `by:`. Byte caps are
class dials.

**`feature:` — the two-precision link.** A terrain mark carries
`feature: <skeleton-feature-id>` so the claim (the coarse mark) and the survey
(the precise geometry in `skeleton.json`) are joined by a field, not a
convention. The engine can follow it to the precise geometry later; nothing
consumes it tonight.

**A terrain mark may pass to a household, and the link goes with it
(founder-ruled 2026-09-10: *"the inlet is terrain; everything else is just a
mark, and belongs to the resident/household"*).** The claim and the survey are
two different things and they may be in two different hands: the mark is
whose ground this is, the skeleton entry is the town's measurement of it, and
a transfer moves only the first. So `feature:` is **not** the town's field —
it is the ground's — and it **survives the transfer** rather than being
stripped with the `tier:` line. Two reasons, both load-bearing rather than
tidy. It is the only record anywhere that the household's claim and the
town's survey describe the same ground. And it is the handle every tool uses
to find the record for a feature: `tools/water-shapes-gen.mjs`
(`recordPathFor`) writes a water body's generated ring onto whichever record
carries the link, and `tools/world-root-gen.mjs` reads it to know which
features are **spoken for** and must not be regenerated in the town's name.
Sever the link and that generator plants a town-authored twin beside the
household's mark, silently — which is the third case in
`tools/world-root-gen.test.mjs`, where it is made to happen on purpose.

**³ `mechanic:` — diegesis points at its machinery (2026-07-23, Keemin-ruled).**
EVERYTHING diegetic is a mark in the tree; where a mark's truth is *kept true by
machinery* (the fog by the crossing-seeded fog model, a declared light by the
signal path, the land's fall by the heightfield), the mark carries
`mechanic: <id>` naming that machinery. Ids come from the **physics registry**
(`skeleton.json § physics_registry` — the roster of mechanics that exist); the
lint refuses a mechanic that is absent or not honored, so a mark can never point
at machinery the world doesn't run. This replaces flag-lists in code (the old
`SIGNAL_MARKS` allowlist): the record declares, the engine reads the record. On
a `predicated` mark, the mechanic applies to the mark it describes (a
`mechanic: signal` predicate makes its parent the signal). The world-law
predicates on the root (`the-fog`, `the-fall-of-the-land`, `the-walking-pace`,
`the-wear`) are generated from the skeleton's own numbers by
`world-root-gen.mjs` — extraction, never hand-copy.

**The river is segmented, not one mark** — each reach the skeleton names is its
own constitution mark with its own `feature:` link. Finer named-reach enrichment
(the residents' own words for Blackwater Bend, the Still Reach pool, the harbor
reach) is part of the filed coverage follow-up, not tonight.

**⁵ `timetable:` — a schedule, and the mark that carries one moves (2026-08-07,
Keemin-ruled).** A mark with `mechanic: timetable` **and** a `timetable:` field
is a scheduled service: a body that moves between stops on a clock. Both halves
are required — the mechanic is the pointer, the field is the schedule, and the
lint refuses either alone. The value is a **one-line JSON record** (the same
lane `points:` rides — the frontmatter reader takes strict JSON for `[…]` and
`{…}` values; the bare `{ x: 1, y: 2 }` spelling is unaffected):

```yaml
mechanic: timetable
timetable: {"vessel": "the-town/the-post-office", "pace": 405, "stops": [{"mark": "the-town/the-post-office", "departs": ["06:00Z", "18:00Z"]}, {"mark": "the-town/the-pando-landing", "departs": ["00:00Z", "12:00Z"]}]}
```

- **`vessel`** — the mark that *is* the moving body. Sited, with an extent: her
  footprint is the boarding zone, and her leaf slug is her handle in the
  movement record.
- **`stops`** — **at least two marks, named by id**, each with UTC `departs`
  times (`HH:MMZ`). **Coordinates are never copied into the schedule** — a stop's
  position is its own mark's `at`, read at derivation time, so moving the mark
  moves the service. Each departure sails to the next stop in the list, cyclically.
- **`pace`** — km per crossing for this line (the vessel's stride, not the
  resident's 60 km dial).

The lint is strict about all of it (`mark-lint.mjs` §8): stops and vessel must
exist and be sited, times must parse, pace must be positive. The mechanic is
**general** — any mark that earns a timetable becomes a moving body by the same
arithmetic (`tools/vessel.mjs`), so a resident may propose a new line by leaving
a mark. Boarding is **presence, not a verb**: stand inside her footprint when she
casts off and you sail; arrival sets you down ashore, outside it. See
[`ENGINE.md`](../ENGINE.md) § the timetable mechanic.

## The grid

`at`/`extent` are **grid meters**, centered on `at`. Origin = **Ferry's crossing**
(the center of the Town Centre; atlas 485,760 at 5 m/px). **x grows east, y grows
south.** Sub-meter is legal.

## The frame — a mark's `at:` is written where it stands (v3, 2026-08-09)

A record's `at:` is **an offset from its parent's centre**, not a world position.
The hearth room is `-2,-1` *from the house*; the house is `0,0` *in its own
ground*; the ground is `400,100` *from the region*. Only the world root carries
world numbers, because the root **is** the frame.

The directory tree already says what contains what. Under v3 the coordinates say
it too, and the two can no longer disagree: **move a container and everything
inside it moves with it**, on the record, with no sweep — its children never
mentioned the world's origin in the first place.

- **The root keeps absolute numbers.** `let-there-be-light` is the frame itself.
- **Open ground is framed on the root's centre** (the origin), so a mark that
  nests directly under the root has the same numbers in both schemas.
- **A predicate carries no centre of its own** — it is its parent continued — so
  a positioned mark beneath one is framed on the nearest *sited/parcel* ancestor.
- **A parent that does not bind is walked past** (§ Containment is not
  authority): the frame origin is the nearest positioned ancestor whose **tier
  ranks at or above the record's own**, and the world's origin when the chain
  holds none. So an outranking child's `at:` is written in **world numbers** —
  the same spelling a mark on open ground uses, for the same reason.
- **`points:` rides the same frame as `at`.** A ring is a set of positions and
  shifts with the mark. **`extent:` is a size and never moves.**

**The tree declares its own frame**, on the one record that is the frame:

```yaml
# WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/mark.md
extent: { w: 320000, h: 320000 }
coords: relative
```

A tree with no `coords:` line is **v2 absolute** and loads exactly as it always
did. The declaration rides *inside the tree* so a clone, a sketchbook, or a temp
fixture carries its frame with it — the frame is a property of the record, never
of the tools reading it.

**Nothing downstream knows.** `loadMarks` composes each mark's world position by
walking parent centres, **once, at load** — so the fold, the lint, the vessel,
the walk engine and the verbs all read `at` in world coordinates and cannot tell
which frame the files were written in. Two extra fields ride each loaded record
for the tools that genuinely need the file's own view: **`_fileAt`** (what the
file says) and **`_origin`** (the centre those numbers are written against).

`tools/migrate-coords.mjs` performed the one-shot v2→v3 rewrite, and
`tools/coords-equivalence.mjs` is its falsifier — it loads the pre-migration tree
with its *own* tools and the migrated tree with these, and compares every mark's
world position, extent and ring. **A writer that emits a world coordinate into a
nested record is now wrong**; take the target's `_origin` and write
`worldToFile(at, _origin)`.

## The body

A present-tense observation, **≤ 150 characters**. It is the mark's face in every
view — write it like a sentence read aloud.

## Regions (forming)

Regions are ordinary marks — a region mark (`by:` a founder or the town) sited over
an extent, with child claim-marks nested inside it. The seeding fleet lands them
from founders' own words after this schema. Which region contains a home is the
fold's answer (`WORLD/containment.json`); since the freeze no directory re-homes
(id unchanged either way — the ledger doesn't move).

## Amendment — the continuation law (2026-08-02, Keemin-ruled)

- **A predicate is its parent continued.** A predicated mark inherits its
  parent's extent completely — its locus is the nearest sited/parcel ancestor,
  whole. Depth adds specificity, never location. (This restores the original
  definition; the promotion-lifecycle reading — predicates maturing into sited
  marks by stamp thresholds — is retired. Predicates describe; sited marks
  place; one never becomes the other.)
- **Predicates may carry children, and their children must be predicates**
  (`predicated` or `naming`). A sited/parcel mark never nests under a
  predicate — geometry needs a geometric parent. Naming marks carry none.
- **The one-file law.** The only `.md` inside the record is a mark's own
  `mark.md` (this file and `README.md`, at the top level, are the two
  exceptions).
  Everything else must be a full mark in its own directory.
- **`imports:` is reserved, not built** — the ruled design (persisted
  investigations: marks whose context auto-injects when building on or under
  the declaring mark) awaits its machinery. Do not author the field yet.
- **The law lives in the record itself:** `let-there-be-light/logos` —
  the conditions of the World as constitution-tier predicates of the root,
  each clause sized to be quoted whole by the gate that enforces it. This
  schema remains the enforced spelling; where prose and record disagree, that
  is a defect to true, not a fork to keep.

---

*v3 landed 2026-08-09 — § The frame. The tree is unchanged; only the numbers
inside it moved, from the world's frame to each mark's own. Every id, every
stake, every extent and every world position is exactly what it was
(`tools/coords-equivalence.mjs` is the proof, not the claim).*

*v2 landed 2026-07-22 night (Jetto, on Wright's tasking; Keemin ruled the one-tree
redesign live). Supersedes the v1 nesting schema (`<household>/` write-scoping):
the tree is now spatial containment rooted at the light, authorship is `by:`, id is
`by`+leaf (every v1 id preserved), and protection tiers are explicit. Sibling
authorities: `MARKS.md` (the law), `tools/marks-fold.mjs` (canon is what it
computes), `tools/mark-lint.mjs` (this schema, enforced), `tools/world-root-gen.mjs`
(the root + terrain, by extraction).*
