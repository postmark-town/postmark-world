// viewer.mjs — THE told-world viewer, one module for both surfaces.
//
// This is the single implementation (Keemin, 2026-07-23: the local build is THE
// one viewer; the site serves this same file as a standalone island). It owns the
// markup, the styles, and every interaction; the host page is a thin shell that
// calls `mountViewer(appEl)`. It computes the field of view CLIENT-SIDE from the
// town's public record. Signed-in acts still cross the office door: this module
// previews the exact intent, then sends one credentialed request on confirmation.
//
// It runs in two habitats and feature-detects which without a config flag:
//   • LOCAL (spectator/server.mjs)  — /WORLD/* off disk, /api/walks live,
//     /atlas/* proxied to postmark.town. Signed-in controls feature-detect off.
//   • ISLAND (postmark.town/world)  — /WORLD/* staged beside the page at build
//     time from the blessed world pin, /atlas same-origin, with signed-in acts
//     crossing the same-origin office.
//
// BOTH HABITATS READ SAME-ORIGIN, and that is a law rather than a coincidence:
// `tools/record-sources.mjs` builds every record's source chain and is forbidden
// to name the world repo's main tip.
//
// One engine, imported the clone's way (relative into the package): the browser
// runs the exact library anyone can `node`. If this page and a clone disagree,
// the office has explaining to do.

 *  12 × 12. A card names the GROUND it is drawn on, and the ground has a name
 *  of its own; nothing has to be picked, so nothing can be picked wrong.
 *
 *  The trailing "parcel" goes because it is filing, not naming: 80 of the
 *  town's 92 parcels carry it in their slug and the other 12 do not
 *  (`berthillon/chez-antoine`, `current-the-reader/the-keepers-flat`), so

 *  three now point at ground the household actually holds. 92 of the town's
 *  households hold one; only for a household with none is the answer absent,
 *  and that absence is the honest one — no parcel, no home yet.
 *
 *  Two sources, one answer: the fold's published `parcels` where a fold is in
 *  hand, else the parcel MARKS the page holds — because the resident path never
 *  opens the fold, and a resident's own read carries their own ground. The two
 *  cannot disagree: measured over all 92 rows at 5f042bb, every parcel mark's

// There used to be a LENS here — True World ⟷ My World — that swapped the whole

// from a published one, and you had to remember which world you were standing in
// to know which. Keemin, 2026-08-04: express the drafts as grey and it is all
// unified. One world, and the marks the town has not published yet simply look
// like it. The swap had nothing left to do and is gone.
//
// A draft is a STATE, not a tier — it can be a home, a law, a bench — so it
// travels as a modifier class beside the tier, exactly as `mech` already does,
// and the tier chip goes on saying which kind of thing it is.
//
// AND WHAT A MARK *IS* RIDES HERE TOO. Marks carry a `class:` — the record's own
// word for what kind of thing a mark is (154 distinct ones in the committed
// world today; `portal-ground`, `thing`, `idea`, `letter`…). It used to reach
// nothing: this is the ONE place render classes are minted, and it read only
// tier and draft, so a door and a basket standing in the same room were the same
// two characters of CSS. Nothing could draw a door as a door without inventing a
// second and rival notion of what a mark is.
//
// So the class travels as one more token, exactly as `is-draft` does and for
// the same reason — a class is not a tier (a portal-ground can be a home, a
// constitution mark, or ordinary market ground), so the accent goes on saying
// its own thing and `c-<class>` says this one. Every coloured surface already
// speaks this string, so pips, footprints, cards, washes, highlights and
// bubbles all receive it in the same act.
//
// SANITISED AT THE MINT, because `class:` is resident-written record text on its
// way into a class attribute — escaped once here rather than trusted at twenty
// call sites, the same discipline every body on this page gets from `esc`.

// ═══════════ THE INTERIOR — a room, seen from inside it ═══════════
//
// Entering is not looking. Outside, the engine ranks a field of view: what the
// eye carries to, ordered by bearing and distance, the whole world competing for
// a place in the telling. Inside, none of that is the question. A room has no
// horizon and no bearing rose; it has WALLS, and the only things in it are the
// things it holds. So the interior is not the exterior with a filter on it —
// it is a second recipe over the same primitives, and openYourEyes is not asked.
//
// ── the one coordinate fact, because it is the opposite of what it looks like ─
//
// SCHEMA v3 lets a mark's `at:` be AUTHORED as an offset from its parent's
// centre — the cup in the waiting room written as { x: 0, y: 1 }. That frame is
// a convenience for whoever is writing the file, and it does not survive the
// fold: `loadMarks` composes world coordinates once, at load, and (its own words)
// "nothing downstream can tell which frame the files were written in".
//
// RECORDS ARE OFFSETS; THE STORE IS ABSOLUTE. The viewer reads the STORE, so
// every `at` it sees is absolute metres — but the record beside it is not, and
// that distinction is the whole of the 2026-08-20 crossing fault. Proof from the
// live tree, and note which number lives where: the crossing bench's RECORD says
// { 87, 83 }, an offset from the Town Centre's centre { -75, -75 }, and the store
// holds their sum, { 12, 8 }.
//
// (This comment used to say "an offset would have been { 87, 83 }" — phrasing the
// record's own value as the hypothetical, which read as though records were
// absolute. They are not. Corrected 2026-08-20; the conclusion above was always
// right for the viewer, for the reason stated: it reads the store.)
//
// Which turns out to be a gift rather than a chore. Because the marks are all in
// one frame, an interior needs NO coordinate transform at all: it is the same
// projection the painting uses — originPx + at / mPerPx — with the origin shifted
// so the room's centre lands in the middle of the floor. One formula, two
// framings. Nothing computes an offset, so nothing can compute one wrongly.
/** WHAT IS IN THE ROOM. `investigate` already answers this — the sited things a
 *  mark geometrically contains, plus the entity children who have crossed into
 *  it — so the interior reads its furniture off the engine rather than deciding
 *  for itself what containment means. This only sorts and shapes that answer:
 *  embodied marks become things on the floor, entity children become bodies.
 *
 *  Nearest-to-centre first, so a budget cut drops the far corner of the room
 *  rather than whichever child the fold happened to list last. */
/** THE INTERIOR BUDGET, and it is not the telling's.
 *
 *  `DIALS.context_budget` (12) exists because a horizon has no natural end: a
 *  look across a landscape must be cut somewhere or it carries the world. A
 *  ROOM has a natural end — its walls — and everything standing inside them is
 *  simply what is in it. There is no editorial judgement left to make.
 *
 *  composeInterior read the telling's dial anyway, so an interior silently
 *  dropped its thirteenth thing (the Lanternstep parcel stood at exactly 12/12
 *  when this was first diagnosed, 2026-08-27): furniture that is in the room, in
 *  the record, and not on the floor, with no cut anywhere for a reader to see.
 *
 *  The number was already written down and already unused: this function has
 *  carried `limit = 40` since it was built, dead code because its caller was
 *  starved upstream. One number now, read by both, so the floor and the engine
 *  cannot hold two opinions about how much of a room a room has.

// ── the paper floor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NO PAINTING IN HERE, and that is a statement about what the atlas IS rather
// than a saving. The painting is the town seen from above — one continuous
// surface, painted once, that every exterior standpoint looks at a different
// part of. A room is not a part of that surface; it is under its roof. Hanging
// the aerial view inside a building would say the ceiling is missing.
//
// So the ground is paper: the drafting sheet a plan is drawn on, with a faint
// square rule so distance is still legible, and a ruled border for the walls.
// Same reason the exterior grid is drawn from the registration rather than
// traced from the paint — the floor is derived, never depicted.
// TWO IMAGE CONTRACTS, and the difference is not cosmetic. A mark-cell mounts
// its picture on a real node by property assignment, so it can carry the shelf's
// ABSOLUTE url safely. An SVG <image href> is built by string concatenation, and
// safeAvatarUrl refuses anything with a protocol or a host on purpose — escaping
// is the wrong tool for a URL. So art bound for the floor is reduced to its
// same-origin PATH, which is both what that whitelist accepts and what makes the
// local rig's /media proxy serve it. The shelf test still gates it: a URL that is
// not on the shelf never becomes a path.
// AND THE SHELF IS ITS OWN HOST, which is why this is a route and not a pathname.
// The shelf lives at media.postmark.town/media/… — a DIFFERENT origin from the
// site, whose own /media/ is a different shelf entirely (the atlas hangs the
// mountain out of it). Taking the shelf url's pathname would therefore point at
// the site's media root and ask it for a file that was never there, which is
// exactly the 404 QA caught. So shelf art gets a prefix that cannot collide with

// has one, overlaid with an svg art slot — the same three-part structure the
// atlas has (full-bleed base, raster art, svg above it), so the two scenes are
// the same shape all the way down and nothing downstream can tell them apart
// (founder's ruling, 2026-08-20: the background is the ONLY scene-unique
// element; everything else is the main world's own render).
//
// The registration is chosen so the room spans ~ROOM_GROUND_UNITS of its own
// svg — which keeps the engine in the same numeric regime the town runs in
// (zoomK ≈ 1, marker scale ≈ 1) instead of the deep-zoom regime past
// MAX_ZOOM_IN that the one-svg approach forced. Same arithmetic, sane numbers.

// add some padding to it so it's not claustrophobic"). Drawn INTO the svg, so

// off the pane's edge is the separate ROOM_ZOOM_OUT_SLACK, and neither
// substitutes for the other.

// tried: it breaks `viewer-interior`'s numeric-regime test, correctly. A pure
// fraction makes every room span the SAME share of its own ground whatever its
// size — `units / (1 + 2 * pad)` — which is what keeps the engine at zoomK ≈ 1
// indoors, the regime the town tuned it for. A metre floor makes that share a

// ── THE TOWN'S GROUND (roomGround's sibling — the town drawn from the record) ─
//
// SCENES.md difference #1 is "Ground source — atlas fetch vs roomGround()", and
// this is the third answer to that same question: the TOWN's ground, generated
// from the world's own record rather than fetched as a rendered drawing. The
// founder's sentence (2026-09-08): "no more atlas background, all world visuals
// are from the world."
//
// EVERY DRAWN ELEMENT NAMES ITS SOURCE, in `data-src`, and the source is a thing
// the record actually holds:
//
//   mark:<id>       a mark's own `points:` ring          (regions, water)
//   feature:<id>    a skeleton feature's own geometry    (cliffs, the bridge, …)
//   light:<id>      a night enclave in skeleton.light    (evermoon-night)
//   light:day-axis  the dawn/dark poles in skeleton.light
//
// That attribute is not decoration; it is the falsifier's handle. A hardcoded
// ring has no source that resolves, and a ring that stops matching the mark it
// names is caught by vertex count and by its first vertex projected back into
// metres (tools/town-ground.test.mjs). A screenshot diff would pass on both.
//
// THE REGISTRATION DOES NOT MOVE. `originPx` / `mPerPx` still come from the
// skeleton's `_grid` — constitution-tier world data, never the atlas — so the
// swap is invisible to the camera, the marker scale and the LOD reference, and
// SCENES.md difference #2 (a per-room frame) stays a ROOM's difference alone.
// What does change is the SHEET: its size is now the bounding box of what the
// world itself draws, padded, rather than the atlas's 1500×2400 canvas. That is
// lawful by the founder's own 2026-08-24 ruling, quoted in mountScene below —
// the painting is the opening view and the LOD reference, and stopped being the
// world's edge.
//
// The town's roster of regions is `REGION_SLUGS`, stated in the record's own
// view (tools/region-outsiders.mjs) rather than re-derived here, because a water
// mark carries a ring too and the sea is not a region. The water's roster is
// `waterFeatures()` + `seaFeature()`, which is the same selection `waterAt()`

// two of them out of step. The viewer grew its readers back. By 09-15 four
// places answered where a body is: the walker draw (the read's standpoint or
// the present row, whichever draw ran last), the hover and the bubble (the
// walk's named target, printed as "at X"), the room roster (passage only), and
// the you-marker (the camera). Sollerino was those readers disagreeing across
// a body — his walk ended at (1088, -794.5), the exact centre of Rei's house,
// with no crossing on the ledger: the room drew nobody (passage only), the
// outside hover said "at rei/the-lanternstep-house" (the walk's target, right
// by accident), and the office's place string named the 0.2 m lantern that
// sits at that same centre. (The first cut of this comment said he stood 0.5 m
// OUTSIDE her parcel; 0.5 m was his distance to its CENTRE — corrected the
// same morning against WORLD/world-state.json.) The flicker was two of them
// disagreeing across time about the reader's own body, once per poll.
// Keemin, 09-15: "Multiple SoTs on location?" Yes.

// excluded, the same question the walk desk's From row asks. Passage is the
// ledger at the clock. The walk's named target is `boundFor`: where the walk
// was going, never where the body is.

// ── THE SPECTATOR'S THREE DISTANCES (Keemin, 2026-09-11) ───────────────────
//
// A RESIDENT loads what they can see; a SPECTATOR is given the town, and the
// town is what the painting cannot afford to draw at full resolution. At the
// opening view the camera holds 7,500 m across about 700 px of pane — eleven
// metres to the pixel — and the overlay was drawing, for every one of the
// town's parcels at once, a clipped photograph, its clip path, a framed roof,
// a name and a hit pip. Measured on the 09-09 synthetic ten-times record
// (11,961 marks, 890 parcels): 8,105 nodes in the overlay, 461 pictures, and
// 53 s before the town appeared. The pictures are ~45 px wide and the parcels
// they stand on are 2.8 px apart, so the reader is handed a contact sheet.
//
// So the drawing asks one question first — HOW MUCH TOWN IS ON SCREEN — and
// every per-mark pass reads the answer. Not how far away a thing is (that is
// the field of view's question, and it is the RESIDENT's), and not how many
// marks there are (which would make the painting change under a reader when
// somebody else published). Metres across the viewport, and nothing else.
//
// The boundaries are Wright's recommended defaults, and they are DIALS in the
// dev pane, not constants buried in a pass — the whole point of the 09-10
// proposal's open calls being open. Their arithmetic:
//
//     metres across = the painting's full width in metres ÷ zoomK
//     (viewer.mjs applyView: `zoomK = full.w / view.w`; the painting is
//      1500 atlas units at 5 m each — WORLD/skeleton.json — so 7,500 m)
//
//     far   > 5,000 m across   (zoomK < 1.5)  the town as a whole
//     mid   1,000–5,000 m      (1.5–7.5)      a district
//     near  < 1,000 m          (zoomK > 7.5)  a street — today's painting

// reading — and a house footprint frames whole.
//
// It is NOT set by resolution. The atlas carries no basemap raster at all, and
// its vector art never pixelates. What binds is the painting's DESIGN SCALE: it
// is symbolic, not a survey drawing — a house is one glyph about 60 atlas units
// (300 m) wide, and place-names are set in painting units, so both grow with the
// camera. Measured on the tallest label in frame, in an 899 px panel:
//     zoomK   6 → 1250 m →  41 px   reads as a map

// markerScale), so the mode is sound; 60 is chosen because it frames a 25 m

// time?" The map drew every home card (~120 px on screen) and every face
// (~50 px) from the resident's ORIGINAL upload — median 1.1 megapixels, 363 MB
// decoded for the town's 83 raster home pictures if every one is in view. The
// media door now puts two small copies beside each raster original it holds
// (postmark-office src/media.mjs § the small copies), at names this file can
// DERIVE from the original's url:
//
//   …/<sha>-96.<ext>    96×96, the square this file's circle clips a face to
//   …/<sha>-256.<ext>   256×286, the home card's own shape (HOME_CARD 52:58)
//
// and this file asks for the one that COVERS what it is about to draw. THE
// SIZE FOLLOWS THE DRAWN SIZE, never a fixed pick (Keemin, 10:2x: would it
// look pixelated when a reader zooms in? — yes, unless the copy follows the
// size; so it follows the size): the glyph's authored units × the pane's
// pixels per painting unit ÷ the marker counter-scale × the device's pixel
// ratio is the box the picture will occupy in DEVICE pixels, and the smallest
// copy that covers that box is the one asked for — none, when the box is
// bigger than both, and the original is drawn as before. A copy is asked for
// ONLY on the door's own grammar (a sha-named object on the media route); the
// site's own /media/<handle>-avatar-card.jpg faces and every other href pass
// through untouched, so nothing is ever asked for that nobody minted.
//
// THE FALLBACK IS AN ERROR EVENT, NOT A MANIFEST. When a copy is not there —
// an original older than the backfill, a copy the box could not cut — the
// <image> fires `error`, and armThumbFallback (a capturing listener on the
// layer, since `error` does not bubble) swaps the href for the original the
// element carries in `data-orig` and remembers the miss, so the next draw
// writes the original directly. Measured against the alternative: a manifest
// of which hashes have copies would cost one fetch on EVERY load and a new
// door (which #2940 forbids); the error swap costs nothing on the happy path
// (one request, the copy) and one extra round trip on a miss (the 404, then
// the original) — and a miss is remembered, so it is paid once per session.

// Square, because the town's placed art is square and a peak is as tall as it is
// wide; the photograph fills that square by `slice` rather than being stretched
// into a shape it was not composed for. It is sized off the record and never off
// the camera, so this layer is drawn once at mount and costs a pan nothing.

// UNCHANGED: the box is the mark's own extent, not a square. Squaring was right
// while this drew one thing — a peak is as tall as it is wide — and wrong for
// the ground a town is made of. `limen/the-descending-terraces` is 300 m by
// 2,200 m on the record; squaring that hangs a 2,200 m picture over a 300 m
// strip, spilling across every neighbour it has.
//
// OVERRULED: on 09-12 the second half of that argument was "a place's picture
// is not a texture to be cropped to taste, so `meet` shows the whole of what
// somebody hung there." Keemin, 09-13, looking at the result: "pando peak looks
// like the image didn't zoom to fill the box-mark (it should)." `meet` inside a
// framed box is a letterbox — the picture floats in the middle with the frame's
// amber around empty ground — and that reads as a picture that failed to load,
// which is exactly how it was reported. A boxed picture fills its box, the way
// a ringed one fills its ring.
//
// So both paths now fill. `fit` survives as the parameter that chooses the BOX
// SHAPE — "meet" means the mark's true extent, "slice" the legacy square — and
// no longer chooses whether the picture crops, because it always does.

// than a pip, a screen box. A parcel's home card is about 45 px wide and the
// snap circle is 18 px around its centre, so the roof and both lower corners of
// every house in town were dead to a click: the reader aimed at the house, hit

// the opposite of what was asked for.

// minted on a class mark tomorrow arrives in the rail with no edit here.

// relative to the law. When the office resolves a `human` actor, the human
// class mark's single grant is what the read will carry, and this renders one
// button — without a `human → ["say"]` line ever being written down.

/**
 * The rail's buttons, from the apex's own `actions` answer.
 *
 * A BUTTON IS AN INITIATOR — the law is `the-town/the-initiator`, slot
 * `availability`: "enabled is the law's answer; what cannot begin is hidden"
 * (WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/logos/the-initiator/). Everything below is
 * the machinery closing the gap to that node, in the sense `the-town/the-gap`
 * means it; if the two ever disagree, the node is what is true.
 *
 * (R17, Keemin 2026-08-18.) Keemin's reading of the
 * old rail: "action being available seems to mean something other than 'you can
 * do this right now' — a lot of them are grayed out when they shouldn't, and
 * they light up when something is already about to be done." He was right, and
 * the cause was that one gray carried FOUR different facts: law-says-no ·
 * office-unserved · viewer-doorless · prereqs-not-gathered. A reader cannot
 * un-mix four facts from one shade, so the gray taught them nothing and lied
 * about three of them.
 *
 * The inversion, and it is the whole of this function:
 *
 *   1. ENABLED IS THE LAW'S ANSWER ONLY. Every entry the apex returns is
 *      already granted at this standpoint (grants × kind × reach) — so every
 *      button this returns is live. Nothing else grays anything; nothing gray
 *      is returned at all.
 *   2. CLICKING BEGINS THE FLOW that gathers what the act needs. "Nothing is
 *      selected" stopped being a wall the moment the button could open the
 *      picker, which is why `moment` is gone from this signature rather than
 *      merely unused: the prerequisite is the flow's business now, and a
 *      parameter kept for a caller that must not pass it is a trap.
 *   3. WHAT CANNOT BE INITIATED IS HIDDEN, filtered by MECHANICAL FACT — the
 *      entry names no handler, or `renderers` holds no door for it. Never a
 *      hand list. So a door landing here makes its button appear with no edit
 *      to this function, and law minted tomorrow still arrives on its own.
 *
 * What rule 3 costs, said plainly: an office-unserved verb (lint L6's red) now
 * leaves the resident's rail silently. That debt belongs on the ops board,
 * which reads the same lint — a resident surface should not wear the office's
 * unfinished work as a disabled button they can never press.

/* ── THE PHONE: THE PAINTING, AND NOTHING ELSE (Keemin, 2026-08-04) ───────────
   Below 720 px the rail was a third of the screen for a column of short words,
   and the Telling's 33 rem cannot fit at all — so the grid dropped them under the
   painting and the page grew a long tail of desk furniture nobody had asked for
   on a phone. Neither runs here. The painting takes the viewport, with its own
   chrome, its bubbles and the walk desk, which is the whole surface anyway.

   What goes with the rail: Act As, the crossing readout, the dev dials, and the
   Telling. All desk work. The site's sign-in cluster is the one thing that must
   NOT go — it is the only human door — so it notices the seat has gone and
   floats instead (WorldSignIn.astro).

   Placed after the base rules on purpose: the .wv-minimap > svg rule below is the
   same specificity as the height:auto default further up, so it is source order
   that decides, and it must be this one. */

   Its clip grows by one pane on every side, so the ground a drag brings into
   the pane is already painted — and grows by no more than that: with the clip
   simply off, the layer took the open-country rect's whole size (50,347 px
   square at the opening zoom, measured over CDP LayerTree). A drag that travels
   further than the margin re-anchors the viewBox (applyView). The pane
   (.wv-minimap, overflow:hidden) is still the frame.
   The layer itself is kept from mount, not made when the hand goes down:
   promoting it at the first drag re-rastered the whole map in one GPU task,
   a 440–530 ms frame on the first drag of every visit (four runs); held from
   mount, that frame is 100–117 ms and every drag after is unchanged. */

// ───────── the resident's read, as the painting and the pane want it ────────
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. On the resident path the page no longer computes the field
// of view: the office does, and the page reads the answer. But every surface
// downstream — `overlayMarks`, `syncWithin`, the card list — was written
// against the ENGINE's radial, an eighteen-field row organised by bearing and
// band. The read is a six-field row and a flat list. This is the one place the
// two meet, and it is a pure function so the meeting can be tested without a
// browser, an office or a fold.
//
// ⚑ WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO (Keemin, 2026-09-10 22:4x — the compact
// read). It does not re-judge anything. No occlusion, no dimming, no salience
// score, no fog: the READ already decided what is visible from that standpoint,
// and a page that recomputed any of it would be a second engine quietly
// disagreeing with the first. Rows carry what the read gave and nothing
// invented. Where the engine's radial had a number this read does not carry,
// the number is ABSENT, not guessed — `tallies` printing nothing is the honest
// outcome, and far better than a count the door never said.
//
// BANDS ARE NOT REBUILT EITHER. The engine's distance bands are its own
// vocabulary, derived from dials this read does not carry. The ruling is that
// the page groups by BEARING and sorts by distance, which is the read's own
// organisation, so each bearing gets one band — the single word below — and the
// resident card list reads bearing-first. `overlayMarks` flattens every band it
// is given, so the painting is unaffected by that choice.

/**
 * An apex/eyes read → the radial shape the painting and the pane consume.
 *
 * `read` is what the office answers: `within` (the containment spine),
 * `nearby` (or `objects` — the same six-field rows under the two doors' two
 * names), and `records` (Half 1: the full mark record for everything named,
 * plus the town's ground).
 *
 * Each row is the RECORD with the read's own positional fields laid over it, in
 * that order: the record supplies `body`, `extent`, `image`, `household`,
 * `weight` — what a card draws — and the read supplies `at`, `bearing`,
 * `distM`, `kind`, `tier`, which are what the STANDPOINT says and must win. A
 * record for an id the read did not name is not a row; the ground set is the
 * floor, not scenery.
 *
 * An id the read names with no record in it is NOT dropped and NOT faked: the
 * row stands with `unread: true` on it, so the page can say so where it would
 * have drawn. A blank where a mark should be is the failure this whole lane is
 * meant to make impossible.

// Keemin, 2026-08-04: the painting draws "the field of view, plus all of yours
// whether it holds them or not". That rule STANDS on the resident path; what
// changed underneath it is that there is no fold to look the ids up in, so the
// `/world/my-marks` rows now carry `at` and `extent` themselves (office,
// 2026-09-10) and this is where they become things a painting can draw.
//
// THE SENTINEL. A mark can carry a position that is not a place: the record
// parks positionless markers out past ±50,000 m, and `townGround` has always
// refused to draw a ring with a vertex beyond that magnitude. One of these is
// live right now — `jetto-of-starforge/the-glass-faces-back` at roughly
// (-96497, -95455) — and it reaches this page like any other placed mark. The
// guard is HERE, on the draw side, rather than in the door: the door's job is to
// report the record faithfully, and a mark whose recorded position is a marker
// is still a mark the portfolio should list. It is the PAINTING that must not
// put it 96 km off the map.
//
// AND IT IS NAMED, NEVER SILENTLY DROPPED. A resident's own mark vanishing from
// their own map with no word is precisely the quiet-failure class this lane
// exists to close; `sentinel` and `unplaced` come back so the page can say how
// many of yours it could not place and why.

 * published marks paid five serial round trips — seconds of a signed-in
 * reader's wait, spent looking at empty panes, for answers that do not depend
 * on each other. The door's FIRST answer already carries `counts`, the whole of
 * what the household owns, so after ONE request the number of pages is known
 * and every remaining page can be asked for together.
 *
 * —— THE MERGE IS ORDER-IDENTICAL TO THE SERIAL WALK ——
 * Pages are consumed in offset order whether they were awaited one at a time or
 * all at once, and the de-duplication is the same `list:id` set, so `merged`
 * comes out row for row what the loop produced. That is the equality the
 * falsifier asserts, and it is why nothing downstream of this had to change.
 *
 * —— AND THE WAVE IS NOT THE ONLY WAY OUT ——
 * `counts` is the door's own claim about itself, and a wave sized from it could
 * in principle come up short. It costs nothing to survive that: when the wave
 * is spent and the walk is still not satisfied, the loop goes on serially from
 * the next offset exactly as it did before. The wave is an optimisation of a
 * walk that still knows how to finish on its own — a silent truncation of a
 * resident's own portfolio is the one outcome this must not be able to produce.
 *
 * `fetchPage(offset)` answers with the door's parsed page, or throws. A page
 * nobody ends up consuming is caught at birth: a walk that finishes early
 * leaves requests in the air, and an unhandled rejection is not a way to report
 * that nothing was wrong.

  //
  // Two consequences worth saying out loud, because both are load-bearing:
  //
  //  • THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO FAIL AT THE NETWORK. The old body could throw on
  //    a 404, a proxy outage or a drawing that had stopped being synced, and the

  //    and the record is already in hand — a page that can tell you where you are
  //    can now also show you.
  //  • THE TOWN HANGS ITS OWN ART. The atlas BAKED mark images into the drawing at
  //    sync time, which is why the town alone passed `placeholderExtents: false`
  //    (SCENES.md difference #6). No baker, no baked art — so the town now runs

  //    difference. SCENES.md is amended in the same commit.

  // ── THE PAINTING ENGINE, AS A SCENE ─────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Everything below used to live inside loadMinimap's closure, which meant the
  // painting could only ever be THE painting: one atlas, one camera, one set of
  // handlers, all of them unreachable from anywhere else. A room has to be a
  // second one of these — its own small map, mounted and unmounted whole — so
  // the body comes out of the closure and takes its ground as an argument.
  //
  // This is a MOVE, not a rewrite. The town instance is the same code in the
  // same order it always ran, including the point where it publishes itself as
  // the active scene: `mapCtx` is still assigned exactly where it was, because
  // the layer builders that run during construction read it, and reordering that
  // would be a behaviour change wearing a refactor's clothes.
  //
  // What the scene needs from its caller is its GROUND and its registration:
  // the <svg> to draw into, and the origin/scale that turn world metres into
  // that svg's units. The town hands it the atlas. A room hands it a floor.
  // Scene options, both defaulted to the town's behaviour so the town call
  // site does not change: `camera` gates the wheel and the drag-pan (a scene
  // that fits its pane refuses a camera — the interiors ruling, generalized),
  // and `includeMine` gates the portfolio union in the draw-set (a room shows
  // what is IN it; your marks elsewhere in town do not follow you through a
  // door — the roof, refused at the source per the 08-20 spike receipt).
  // `zoomOutLimit` caps how far OUT the wheel may go. OUTDOORS it is a multiple
  // of the full view (the town keeps MAX_ZOOM_OUT, and the world frame has
  // superseded it as the actual bound). IN A ROOM it is a multiple of the
  // CONTAIN-FIT — the whole room as this pane shows it — and a room passes 1,
  // which with ROOM_ZOOM_OUT_SLACK is "the whole room, plus a breath".
  //
  // ⚑ THE REFERENCE CHANGED, THE RULING DID NOT (POS-95). It used to be a
  // multiple of `full` on both roads, and `full` is the ground's own box: in a
  // pane wider than the room that box is NARROWER than the view the room rests
  // at, so the cap sat inside the resting view and cropped the walls the moment
  // the wheel moved. The founder's revised camera ruling (2026-08-20 evening)
  // is untouched by the repair: a room has a camera, the whole rail with it,
  // but its outermost state IS the whole room — you can dive into a corner and
  // come back, never drift into the void past the walls. What changed is that
  // "the whole room" is now measured against the pane it is being shown in.
  // `placeholderExtents` gives every art-less embodied mark a programmatic
  // stand-in (founder, 2026-08-20, revising his own always-on footprints): its
  // extent filled with a deterministic per-mark colour at LOW SATURATION — full
  // presence, muted hue — so a room reads as a floor plan and nested
  // placeholders read as distinct blocks. Drawn by the ONE overlay, gated by
  // the scene; the town keeps its footprint toggle unchanged.

  //
  // Keemin, 2026-09-12, looking at the mountain: "oh yes that's beautiful.
  // let's do that." So it stops being about the mountain. Any mark big enough
  // to be a PLACE rather than a thing in one, that carries a picture, wears it
  // over the ground it actually covers.
  //
  // WHERE IT DRAWS. `wv-placed-art-layer`, which is new, and the reason it is
  // new is written where it is created: the mountain's old layer sat at the
  // FRONT of the svg, which is under the town's generated ground, so a picture
  // hung on a district was painted and then buried. On open country, where the
  // mountain lives, there was no ground to be under and nobody noticed. The new
  // layer sits after the ground and before the grid, and it is filled from the
  // draw cycle rather than once at mount, so it is culled and tier-gated like
  // everything else the camera governs.
  //
  // THE TIERS. `far` and `mid` only. `near` is the card-and-room world, where a
  // reader is close enough that the house cards and the furnishing pass are
  // saying it better, and a district-sized photograph underfoot is a wall. The
  // resident path (`tier` null) draws it, which is what it did yesterday — the
  // mountain was on that path unconditionally.
  //
  // WHY `allMarks()` AND NOT THE RADIAL'S SET, the same reason the houses pass
  // below reads it: a landmark is not field-of-view furniture. The mountain is
  // 135 km out and in nobody's radial, and a district a reader has not walked
  // is still a district. The viewport cull is what bounds the work, exactly as

    // the root everything else hangs off. `parent` is read as a fallback only
    // because the enclosing rule next door reads both and a record that starts
    // using it should not silently escape this.
    //
    // WHAT IS ASKED IS DEPTH, AND THE HONEST MEASURE OF DEPTH IS THE HANGING
    // SET, NOT THE ROOT. A literal "direct child of the root" reads well and
    // deletes the mountain: the mark that carries Pando's picture is
    // `vermillion/the-pando-peak`, whose placementParent is
    // `the-town/pando-peak` — so the pictured mark is a GRANDCHILD of the root
    // and would stop hanging, which is the one outcome the ruling explicitly
    // did not want. What the ruling is actually protecting against is two
    // pictures stacked on the same ground. So: a mark hangs unless some mark
    // BETWEEN it and where you stand is hanging one too.

  // server has it on disk and the site stages it, so both habitats can answer.
  //
  // THIS READER IS WHY `tools/record-sources.mjs` EXISTS. It used to end at
  // `raw.githubusercontent.com/…/main/WORLD/walk-ledger.md`, and because the
  // site's staging list did not carry the file, prod took that leg EVERY TIME —
  // the town's departures were told from the world's unblessed main tip while
  // the release lane's guardrail said "tags only, never main tip". A fallback
  // that fires on every load is not a fallback; it is the mechanism.
  // ── THE OFFICE GOES FIRST, BECAUSE THE FILE STOPPED (POS-84, 2026-09-16) ──
  //
  // `WORLD/walk-ledger.md` FROZE on 2026-08-10T20:25Z by its own seam line —
  // "the walk ledger freezes with honor" — and every departure since lives in
  // the store. This loader had no office leg, so the only source it could reach
  // was that frozen file, and Lately showed nothing the town had done in five
  // weeks. Measured on prod 2026-09-16: `/api/world2/walks` held 2,498
  // departures, 348 of them in the last four days, and this pane could show
  // none of them. The map's walkers were never affected — they read
  // `/world/walkers`, which is live.
  //
  // So this is the enter-exit ledger's shape, and for its reason, said there:
  // "an office reads the clone it actually has while a staged file is a
  // photograph". The frozen file stays as the FALLBACK, which is what a page
  // served from somewhere with no office still has to read.
  //
  // WHY THE WINDOW IS ALSO CUT HERE. The door takes `?since=` as of the w39
  // train (office PR #71); prod's does not yet, and answers the whole record —
  // 1.17 MB, 2,498 rows — to any query at all. This pane shows fourteen rows.
  // So the office's answer is cut to the same fortnight it asked for, and the
  // day the door ships the window the cut becomes a no-op rather than a second
  // opinion.
  //
  // THE CUT IS NOT APPLIED TO THE FILE, and that is deliberate. Every row in
  // the frozen ledger predates any window this page would ask for, so cutting
  // it to a fortnight would not trim a fallback — it would delete one, and
  // leave a page with no office reporting a town where nobody ever went
  // anywhere. The 304 frozen rows stay the era's fallback, exactly as they are
  // today. The cut is a guard against a door that ignores the window, and it

  // source and report a room the local record says has been emptied.
  // THE CROSSINGS MUST COME FROM A LIVE SOURCE, and until now none of these were.
  //
  // The site stages WORLD/enter-exit-ledger.md as a BUILD ARTIFACT, pinned to the
  // world sha the site was built from. Crossings land continuously, so it is a
  // photograph. A resident could walk through a door, refresh, and be told they
  // were still outside — which is exactly the last lie standing between the
  // founder's click and his interior, and it is not a caching bug: that file is
  // simply OLD.
  //
  // So the office goes FIRST. It reads the clone it actually has, the same move
  // /world/state already makes for the marks. The staged file stays as the
  // fallback, because a page served from somewhere with no office (the local
  // spectator, a bare clone) must still derive occupancy — stale crossings are
  // worth more than none.
  //
  // THE THIRD LEG IS GONE (2026-08-26). It read the world repo's main tip, which
  // is the one source the release lane's guardrail forbids — "tags only, never
  // main tip" — and stale-from-main is not "as good as it ever was", it is a
  // different world. Both remaining sources are same-origin, so both are the
  // world this page was built from.
  //
  // WHAT DOES NOT MOVE: occupancy is still derived IN THE READER. The office
  // hands over the ledger TEXT and this parses it, because who folds the rooms is
  // a constitutional question and this is only a question of which bytes.
  // THE RETIRED LEGS ARE GONE (2026-08-28, #2152). For one grace window this
  // asked the old `threshold-ledger` name after the new one, because the office,
  // this package and the site's viewer bundle deploy on three separate clocks
  // and a page built after the rename could be talking to an office built before
  // it. That window is closed on the side this file can see: the twin file is
  // deleted from this package, so its same-origin leg could only ever 404 now,
  // and the office has answered the enter/exit spelling since 2026-08-26, so the
  // office leg it used has a live sibling that goes first anyway.
  //
  // The other direction — a bundle built BEFORE the rename, still deployed —
  // is not fixed here and cannot be: those bytes are already shipped. It asks
  // the office's `/world/threshold-ledger` door, which still answers, and its
  // same-origin leg 404s into `noteRecordAbsence`, which is a named absence
  // rather than a wrong answer. It catches up at the next site repin.

  // Lately is fed by four independent arrivals — the walk ledger, the
  // settlements, the stake events, and (on the resident path) the resident's
  // own read — and every one of them used to paint the moment it landed. The
  // walk ledger is 43 KB and always landed first, so the FIRST list a reader
  // saw was departures alone, and it could not survive the sort once anything
  // else was in hand. Measured on prod 2026-09-15, signed in: 14 rows at 13.0 s,
  // every one a "set out"; at 17.5 s all 14 replaced. That first list was drawn
  // to be thrown away.
  //
  // So `renderActivity` is a no-op until boot says the lanes have settled. It
  // is not "render less"; it is "do not publish a list you already know is
  // provisional". A named record ABSENCE still shows through — that heading is
  // the only place the page says a record went unread, and a reader is owed it
  // whether or not the rail is ready.
  //
  // After the gate opens, every later arrival renders normally and ADDS rows.
  // Adding is not the bug; replacing wholesale was.
