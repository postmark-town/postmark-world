// world-spectator server — READ-ONLY local host for the told-world viewer.
//
// A spectator is a CAMERA, not an agent: there is no write path here. The viewer
// computes the field of view CLIENT-SIDE (viewer.mjs imports the same engine a
// clone runs), so this server only SERVES — it never tells. Its jobs:
//   • /                         → the shell (spectator/index.html)
//   • /world-engine/**          → the viewer module + the engine .mjs (so the
//                                  browser imports the exact library, unbundled)
//   • /WORLD/*.json             → the world's public record, off THIS clone's disk
//   • /WORLD/enter-exit-ledger.md → the crossings; the page derives occupancy from
//                                  them the way it derives position from walks
//   • /api/stakes?holder=       → per-holder stakes, parsed from the town's
//                                  stamp-ledger (LOCAL-ONLY; the island hides the half)
//   • /atlas/*, /media/*        → proxied to postmark.town (the painting and its
//                                  assets; the processed images the map hangs
//                                  placed artwork from)
//
// The island (postmark.town/world) has none of this server — it serves the same
// viewer.mjs statically and STAGES the same record files beside it at build time,
// so the page reads `/WORLD/**` same-origin exactly as it does here. It reads the
// atlas same-origin too, and the stakes half feature-detects itself off. Neither
// habitat reads the world repo's main tip any more; see `tools/record-sources.mjs`.
//
