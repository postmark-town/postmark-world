## The model

The world is scenes all the way down. The main world is itself an entered state
on `the-town/let-there-be-light` (always-entered, ruled 2026-08-18) — the
biggest room in the game — and every mark with an inside is a smaller one.
`mountScene({ boxEl, svg, originPx, mPerPx, … })` is the ONE engine: it takes a
GROUND (an svg document) and a REGISTRATION (origin/scale turning world metres
into that svg's units) and mounts the entire painting machinery on it — layers,
overlay, walkers, hover, click precedence, choosers, walk desk, bubbles, camera.

- The town's ground is `townGround(marks, skeleton)`, registration from the
  skeleton's `_grid`. **It was the atlas** (`/atlas/town.html`, a drawing
  rendered in the town repo and synced to the site) **until 2026-09-08**, when
  the founder ruled: *"no more atlas background, all world visuals are from the
  world."* Same sheet, same registration, different source — the regions' and
  the water's own `points:` rings, the skeleton's light poles and night
  enclaves, and its terrain features. Every drawn element names its source in
  `data-src` (`mark:<id>` · `feature:<id>` · `light:<id>` · `light:day-axis`),
  which is what makes "from the world" a thing a test can read rather than a
  claim a screenshot would pass on.
- A room's ground is `roomGround(mark)`: the **paper floor** — a full-bleed
  drafting sheet (warm paper, squared with a ruled grid at a round number of
  metres, the room's own boundary drawn as the wall — its POLYGON RING where the
  mark carries one, its at/extent box where it does not, because for a mark that
  is a rectangle the box IS the shape), the mark's own image over
  its footprint when it has one, and an (initially empty) svg art slot — the
  same base-raster-svg structure the atlas has, so the two grounds are the same
  shape all the way down. (The founder's word, revising his own earlier white.)

Entering swaps scenes the way a door works in Pokémon: the town's svg comes out
of the box whole (held aside, listeners alive), the room's ground mounts through
the same `mountScene`, and the module-level `mapCtx` pointer swap carries every
consumer with it. Exiting reverses the swap without a refetch. Lazy per-room
loading later needs nothing rewired: a scene's input is a plain ground +
contents, wherever they came from.

## The complete difference list

Every code-level difference between the town scene and a mark scene, each with
its justification. There are **eight** live (2026-09-08: #6 was retired by the atlas
merge — see its row; 2026-09-11: #9 added).

| # | Difference | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Ground source** — `townGround(marks, skeleton)` vs `roomGround(mark)` | The founder's ruling itself: the background is the ONE scene-unique element. Same layer slot, same structure, different src. **Narrowed 2026-09-08:** it used to be a fetch versus a function, and the fetch was the last thing on this page that read a surface the world does not own. Both grounds are now generated from the record by a sibling function, so the difference is which record — the town's whole ground versus one mark's floor — and no longer where the picture comes from. |
| 2 | **Registration** — the skeleton grid vs a per-room frame (`ROOM_GROUND_UNITS` span) | Keeps the engine in the numeric regime the town tuned it for (zoomK ≈ 1, marker var ≈ 1). A shared frame forced rooms to zoomK 400–600 — past `MAX_ZOOM_IN`, where markers blow out and atlas text drowns the art. Same arithmetic, sane numbers; QA-asserted. |
| 3 | **`zoomOutLimit: 1`** — the wheel's zoom-OUT clamp is the whole room (the town keeps `MAX_ZOOM_OUT`); everything else on the camera — zoom-in, pan, the full `.wv-mapctl` rail (fit, follow, grid, footprints, conversations) — is the town's own, live | The revised camera ruling (founder, 2026-08-20 evening, superseding "a room refuses a camera"): a room HAS a camera, but its outermost state IS the whole room — dive into a corner, toggle the extent outlines, read the talk, and fit brings the floor back; you never drift past the walls into the void. |
| 4 | **`includeMine: false`** — the portfolio union (`state.mineIds`) stays out of the draw-set | The roof. Without it every mark the acting resident owns anywhere in town enters `glyphIds` and stays hit-testable from inside a room (2026-08-20 spike receipt). Refused at the source, not filtered later. |
| 5 | **The room card** — `.wv-room-card`, the entered room's own card held OPEN at the pane's upper left in every view mode, with the one way out inside it; the corner dot (`.wv-worldmark`) stands down while it is up. **Revised 2026-09-23 (POS-206)** from "the exit chrome — `.wv-scene-exit`, bottom-left of the pane". | The way out must exist where the reader is. The telling's own exit collapsed with the telling in painting-only — the DEFAULT mode — which is how the founder stood in a room with no visible door (the b6 diagnosis); the pane pill answered that. Keemin, 2026-09-23: *"just always have that mark card expanded, and sitting in the upper left, and move the 'exit' button* into *the card while making it easily distinguishable."* So the card the corner dot used to reveal on a hover or a click (`syncRoomCard`: the room's mark cell, its predicates and its expansion, the pinned bubble's recipe and dress) is simply open, the way out sits on its own ruled row inside it, and the pill and the telling's copy are gone. Same `.wv-int-exit-btn` class and handler: one card, one exit, one click route. Outdoors nothing changes — the dot is the frame's, as before. |
| 6 | ~~**`placeholderExtents: true`**~~ — **RETIRED 2026-09-08. NOT A DIFFERENCE ANY MORE: both scenes pass `true`.** | This row's justification was *"the town needs no such pass because the atlas bakes art at sync; a room has no baker"* — and on 2026-09-08 the town stopped being served by the baker. `townGround()` draws geometry, never images, so an unfurnished town would have hung nothing at all: 540 sited marks as bare pips over a ground with no houses on it. The pass itself is unchanged and its founder's word still governs it (2026-08-20, replacing always-on footprints: inside a room, furniture without its footprint is a dot pretending to be a table; distinctness comes from hue, never transparency; the same mark is the same colour for every reader on every load; drawn by the ONE overlay). What changed is that it is no longer *scene-unique* — which is the direction this list is supposed to move. The town keeps its footprint toggle, unchanged. **Revised 2026-09-11** (founder: *"reduce the opacity of placeholder mark-images to around 50%"*): the blocks draw at half opacity in both scenes — the never-transparency half of the 08-20 word is withdrawn, the hue half stands. |
| 7 | **At-rest refit letterboxes** — a contained scene sitting at its full view letterboxes on pane reshape (contains the ground, centred); once zoomed in, the town's keep-width refit takes over | The room-shown-whole guarantee at rest (scene-qa's pip at y=−183 is the receipt), without fighting the hand once a hand exists. One branch on the same `zoomOutLimit` signal as #3. |
| 8 | **`sceneWalkerSet`** — WHICH bodies the walk layer may draw, and nothing else about them: indoors, the room's own manifest (the crossing record's occupants, child rooms included); outdoors, the whole town, unchanged. How a body is drawn and where it stands are untouched — see the walker clause below | The founder's word (fix list 2026-08-29, reaffirmed 2026-08-31): *"resident activity OUTSIDE the interior is visible from interior view."* A room's ground carries its own registration (#2), so every walker in town projected onto it and anyone whose COORDINATES happened to fall inside the footprint was painted on the floor — 81 bodies offered, 2 of the 6 that landed being people the record puts in other rooms entirely. But standing on it is not being in it: coordinates answer `within`, a room is `insideOf`, and `standpointOccupancy`'s own header says the two "routinely disagree." The telling has enforced the crossing answer for its bodies since the room shipped; the floor was never asked the question, and a reader believes what they can see. Refused at the source like #4, so a body outside the room never becomes a glyph and cannot be hit, hovered or chosen either. |
| 9 | **The parcel underfoot wears no card** — `enclosingParcels(sceneRoomId, byId)`, asked once per draw: the mounted room's own parcel (itself, or the parcel its `parent`/`placementParent` chain reaches) is skipped by both house passes — no card, no pip, no glyph id. Outdoors nothing is mounted and the set is empty. | Founder, 2026-09-11: *"let's not display the parcel card when the view is the parcel itself or anything within it."* A card is a landmark seen from outside; drawn over the floor you are standing on it is the roof over your head. Every other parcel in view keeps its card, exactly as outside — the inside-as-outside rule (What was deleted, 2026-09-11) is what makes this the ONE exception rather than a gate. |

Additionally, the **draw-set source** differs by construction, not by branch:
`drawOverlay` consumes whatever radial the telling hands it. Outdoors that is
the FOV radial from `openYourEyes`; indoors it is `investigate`'s containment
answer dressed in the radial's own grammar (`composeInterior`). One consumer,
two lawful askers — the same seam the telling itself has always had.

**Everything else is byte-identical because it is the same code path**: pips
(`overlayPipSVG` + `markerScale` + the one `--wv-mk` variable), hover snap and
the glance, click precedence (faces → chooser → wash → mark → open ground),
contested-click choosers, the walk desk and leg preview, stake sheets, say,
bubbles, highlight, footprint/grid toggles, walkers (positions from the same
poll — a body the walk ledger places stands there; the plaque, not the floor,
carries ledger-occupancy for the unplaced).

That walker clause stands unamended, and it is worth saying why, because it was
briefly mistaken for the licence behind #8 and it is not one. It answers *where a
body stands* and *who the plaque speaks for*, and both answers survive #8 intact:
a drawn body still stands exactly where the ledger puts it — including outside
the wall, which is why 8 bodies draw in the Protected Grove while only 4 land on
its floor — and an in-room body the ledger never placed is still the plaque's to
carry, not the floor's. **Which** bodies are eligible to be drawn at all is a
different question, one this list simply never asked; #8 is where it is asked now.

## What was deleted

- **2026-09-11 (founder: "outside and inside should REALLY not be that different"):** two gates this list never carried — the house pass skipped indoors ("the roof rule") and the parcel column answering null indoors. Both removed; the houses draw and click inside exactly as outside.

The parallel interior renderer: `interiorSVG`, `interiorThingSVG`,
`interiorBodySVG`, `paperFloorSVG`, `interiorFraming`, `interiorPx`,
`interiorRuleM`, `interiorRecipe`, `labelPlacer`, the `.wv-interior-panel`
overlay and its CSS. A second way to express a mark is a permanent divergence
tax (one-question-one-owner); it is gone, not deprecated.

What survives of the old interior is *chrome and data*, not render: the room
card (`roomCardHTML` around the room's own mark cell — its name and its own
words, open on the painting, since POS-206), the plaque (`interiorPlaqueHTML` —
who else is in the room, in the telling), the contents cards, `interiorFurniture`
(the sorted containment answer), and `rimPointOf` (where the camera lands on
exit).

## Labels — resolved as "no difference"

The viewer draws **no labels in either scene**: the town's place-names are the
atlas's OWN baked text (art, not viewer), and names in both scenes ride hover,
bubbles, and cards — identical machinery. The old floor's `labelPlacer` names
were a viewer-side second label system; deleted with it. If room names ever get
baked into a room's ground art, that is ground authorship, the same way the
atlas does it. (Counter-scaling the atlas's own labels at deep zoom remains an
atlas-side unlock, noted in the `MAX_ZOOM_IN` comment — town art work, not
scene work.)

## The controls

- `tools/qa/town-fingerprint.mjs` — the town must not move: structural
  fingerprint (layer identity + paint order, camera, overlay shape, every pip's
  placement transform), clock-pinned, refuses verdicts across mismatched
  exposures. Green at this refactor.
- `tools/qa/scene-qa.mjs` — the room must work: mounts as a scene, white
  ground, roof holds, pips through the one overlay, the room card open at the
  pane's upper left in BOTH view modes with the one exit inside it and the
  corner dot stood down (POS-206; it was "exit bottom-left in the default
  mode"), wheel inert, hover/select/bubble in both view modes, floor click arms
  the real walk desk, stacked exits walk out level by level through the card's
  button, town remounts whole with the card gone and the dot back. Its rig left
  the repo with `demo/` — the file's header says what a rig must provide.
